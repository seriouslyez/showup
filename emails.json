Yardfest is behind us and the semester is nearly over, but the HUA is still hard at work delivering for you. This email includes important updates about the Summer Storage Program, Senior Week, Intersectional Earth Week, and a financial aid fair organized by the Inclusion Team!\n\n\n** Senior Week\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the first time ever, the HUA will be providing $5,000 in funding to Senior Week! The Senior Week planning committee starts with a budget of $0 and has had to raise event ticket prices every year. We want to ensure that every senior can enjoy the week’s events, and hope to set a lasting precedent for future years. Stay tuned for more updates from the Class Marshals about Senior Week events!\n\n\n** Financial Aid Fair\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe HUA Inclusion Team is hosting a Financial Aid Fair!\n\nWhat: The Financial Aid Fair is an opportunity for students to get together and have a designated space and time to work on their financial aid applications. As the due date for financial aid materials approaches (May 1st), this fair will also be a time for students to get support and assistance from Financial Aid Officers throughout this process. We will provide food (Raising Canes) and drinks for participants.\n\nWhen: Thursday, April 20th ( 5pm- 6:45pm)\n\nWhere: Science Center Hall C\n\n\n** Summer Storage\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRegister for the 2023 Summer Storage Program (https://airtable.com/shr1hvx0yR2LIFquz)\n\nRegistration\n\nClaim your spot in the Summer Storage Program by clicking the above button!\n\nThe Harvard Undergraduate Association will partner with Five Stars Movers to provide a Summer Storage Program by renting a warehouse for students to store their belongings until they return to campus in Fall 2023. To store until Fall 2023, the cost will be $15 per box which is significantly cheaper than Olympia and CollegeBoxes. With your Student Activities Fee (SAF), we were able to successfully negotiate a cheap alternative. This is an excellent example of using SAF funds to benefit students. Additionally, this year’s storage program is protected by a legally-binding contract that was approved by Harvard and the storage company. This will ensure financial protection for students and establish clear expectations for everyone to avoid some past issues.\n\nLogistics\n\nWe have altered the drop-off dates by pushing them one day later. Additionally, we successfully negotiated a drop-off site accessible to freshmen in the Yard that will live in the Quad Fall 2023.\n\nRiver Drop-off and Pick-up:\n\nThe Drop-off and Pick-up location for the River Houses (Fall 2023) will be located at Beren Hall at the corner of Mill and Plympton Street by Winthrop (River Location (https://goo.gl/maps/osvXt2ASWzCmGme9A) ). All days will operate between 10:00am to 5:00pm. These are the finalized corresponding Drop-off and Pick-up Dates:\n\n1. Drop-off May 6th and Pick-up Sept. 4th\n\n2. Drop-off May 9th and Pick-up Aug. 30th\n\n3. Drop-off May 11th and Pick-up Sept. 3rd\n\n4. Drop-off May 12th and Pick-up Sept. 2nd\n\nQuad Drop-off and Pick-up:\n\nThe Drop-off and Pick-up location for the Quad Houses (Fall 2023) will be located at the Quad Main Lot between Bertram and Eliot Halls (Quad Location (https://goo.gl/maps/LRcxWD8zj2K9jp9k7) ). All days will operate between 11:00am to 3:00pm. These are the finalized corresponding Drop-off and Pick-up Dates:\n\n1. Drop-off May 9th and Pick-up Aug. 30th\n\n2. Drop-off May 11th and Pick-up Sept. 3rd\n\n3. Drop-off May 12th and Pick-up Sept. 2nd\n\nLittauer Drop-off for Quadded Freshman:\n\nThe Storage Program successfully negotiated an additional location for freshman in the Yard that will live in the Quad Fall 2023 (Littauer Parking Lot Location (https://goo.gl/maps/QdA2mKjBV1qsY5ue9) ). Drop-off will operate will operate between 11:00am to 3:00pm.\n\n1. Drop-off May 6th at Littauer Parking Lot and Pick-up Sept. 4th at the Quad location.\n\nAdditional Key Information\n1. We expect to close form submissions on May 3rd at 11:59pm or when we reach our 6000 box limit, whatever comes first.\n2. The storage company has agreed to sell boxes before the scheduled drop-off dates at $8/box. Time and location are still being discussed, but are aimed to be during Reading Period. You may find other options elsewhere like FedEx or UPS stores.\n3. Box dimensions are 18” by 18” by 24”. Medium-sized luggage with approximately the same volume is acceptable as a box. If oversized, please consult this sheet (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhkjn864yTWudy0n5IS85ihwADrWxhTftGt6NLouE2U/edit?usp=sharing) .\n4. Friends are allowed to drop off other boxes. They are required to display proof of payment and have all of their boxes in the name of the owner.\n5. Do not leave any important documents or items you may need during the storage window. The storage company will charge $200.00 fee to the student for rummaging through the boxes’ contents at the warehouse.\n6. Maximum cap of 10 boxes per student.\n7. Any oversized items will be charged on-the-site by the storage company. For example, if you have 7 items (3 oversized, 4 regular), you still pay 7 items * $15/item = $105. Extra charges will be made by the company with their discretion.\n8. Do not worry about overpaying us. We will have a refund system set up after the completion of the drop-off dates to address this.\n9. You may split up your boxes between drop-off dates. However, you will then expect to pick up different boxes on the different corresponding pick-up dates in the Fall.\n\nThe Team\n\nLeading the team is Corbin Lubianski as Overall Program Head, Jerelyn Fernandez as On-the-Day Captain, and Autumn Dorsey as Communication Head. We also want to note the Residential Life Officer Hamza Masoud for also leading this program with us.\n\nWe desperately rely on volunteers to make sure questions are answered by monitoring our email and helping out on-the-day.

I have not yet chosen\n\nthe school that will cost their life savings.\n\n \n\nI close and seal the scholarship rejections.\n\nMy first paystub folds back into the letter.\n\n\nMy forehead unkisses the floor and I pass\n\nthe red envelope back to my mother.\n\n \n\nWe move into a smaller, more crowded house,\n\nwhere I fry sesame seeds with Lao Lao, and the HOA\n\n\nreprimands us for growing winter melon on the porch.\n\nI pedal backwards on my sister&rsquo;s bike. I hand back\n\n \n\nher worn clothes. We put coins from our palms\n\nback into our father&rsquo;s coat, having just told him good job\n\n \n\nbecause we think this is what he earns in a day,\n\nand it is enough. He&rsquo;s about to come home.\n\"Learning Money in Reverse\" by Stephanie Niu.

The U.S. marched toward victory in World War II while Franklin\nRoosevelt was ailing in 1944 and 1945. Four decades later, the government\nmanaged its relationship with a teetering Soviet Union while Ronald Reagan’s\nmental capacities slipped. In each case, White House aides, Cabinet secretaries\nand military leaders performed well despite the lack of a fully engaged leader.\n\nThe issue that makes many Democrats even more anxious than Biden’s second-term\ncapabilities is whether his age will prevent him from winning a second term. If\nenough voters are turned off by the idea of a president who would turn 86 in\noffice, Republicans might win full control of the federal government in 2024 —\nand Donald Trump might return to the White House.\n\nI know that it may seem crass for Democrats to worry more about partisan\npolitics than the mental acuity of the country’s most powerful person. But it’s\nnot entirely irrational. Today, I will look at the biggest question about\nBiden’s re-election campaign — which he formally announced yesterday\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ahX63mkVCfO4qVVuVKHImA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmK4RDP0TiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vbGl2ZS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwL3VzL2JpZGVuLTIwMjQtcHJlc2lkZW50LWVsZWN0aW9uLW5ld3M_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyNiZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MTA4NSZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxMzc1JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkPkP_SGT7XDvNUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA]\n— and how he might address that question.\n\n\nA GAFFE MACHINE\n\nAt 80, Biden can be an unsteady public performer.

In the upcoming campaign,\nyou can imagine that a verbal misstep could cause some swing voters to wonder\nwhether Biden is up for a second term.\n\nThese concerns help explain why polls show that roughly three-quarters of\nDemocratic voters approve of Biden’s performance but slightly less than half\nwant him to run for a second term.\n\nOf course, there would be a simple way for Biden to address the concerns: He\ncould spend more time speaking in public now and demonstrate his vigor. Instead,\nhe and his aides have chosen the opposite approach.\n\n\nTHE QUIET STRATEGY\n\nBiden has held fewer news conferences per year than any president since Reagan.\nBiden gave fewer interviews during his first two years in office than any\npresident in even longer:\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/25/briefing/oakImage-1682455059225/oakImage-1682455059225-jumbo.png]Sources:\nThe American Presidency Project; Martha Joynt Kumar | By The New York Times\n\nMichael Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, says that Biden’s\naides are unapologetic about avoiding interviews and news conferences. “They see\nthese traditions as outdated and unimportant,” Michael told me. “They say that\ntraditional media don’t have clout, and they think that there are many other\nways that he can better present himself.”\n\nBut Biden has not replaced media conversations with other means of engaging with\nthe public. He does not hold regular town-hall meetings, for example. And the\nstatistics on interviews in the chart above include Biden’s recent conversations\nwith people other than journalists, like Drew Barrymore and Jason Bateman, both\nactors, and Manny MUA, a YouTube beauty expert.\n\nBiden’s strategy of minimizing unscripted public appearances suggests that his\nstaff believes the risk often isn’t worth the reward.\n\n\n‘WATCH ME’\n\nBiden and his aides have said that his age is a legitimate issue for debate but\nthat he has demonstrated he is up to the job. “The only thing I can say is,\n‘Watch me,’” Biden likes to say.\n\nThere certainly are reasons to think that Biden is up for both the substantive\nand performative parts of the job.

He passed a blizzard\nof legislation, including more bipartisan bills than almost anybody expected,\nand managed both the pandemic and the West’s pro-Ukraine alliance.

Maybe voters\ncare less about Biden’s age than political pundits do and will re-elect him for\nthe same reasons they elected him: He conveys an aura of moderation and\ncompetence when many other parts of the American political system do not.

Thank you to everyone who could\nmake it. Strides in Solidarity, an annual 5k that PIHE chapters across the\nnation organize, is meant to express the distance many of the PIHE\ncommunity health workers walk everyday to accompany their patients. PIHE's\nmission would not be carried out if not for the community health workers,\nso Strides in Solidarity shows our appreciation for them. This year we\nfundraised for the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda, which will\nbe training the next generation of doctors and medical professionals!\n\nIf you would like to donate please feel free to use this link:\nhttps://pih-ughe.donorsupport.co/-/NTVCZJDE\nOr, spread the word by forwarding this email!\n\nIn solidarity,\nHarvard PIHE Board\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n\"Harvard PIH Engage\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to harvard-pih-engage+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msgid/harvard-pih-engage/578844c8-b341-434c-8711-5be556fa859dn%40googlegroups.com\n<https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/harvard-pih-engage/578844c8-b341-434c-8711-5be556fa859dn%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer>\n.\n\n_______________________________________________\nFYRE mailing list\nFYRE@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/fyre\n"}],"259058639":[{"date":"2023-04-27T10:34:00.000Z","subject":"The Morning: The fight over the debt limit","text":"[https://nl.nytimes.com/q/4Iwuk2WBI6ztA5J5NaRlEg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRPVcDbnl0QgpkSJFRSmQ7W8uzUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA]\nRepublicans are trying to force a negotiation.\nView in browser\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/sxWkqLWY5iGN5c-r3ixEPA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP4QlAWh0dHBzOi8vbWVzc2FnaW5nLWN1c3RvbS1uZXdzbGV0dGVycy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZW1wbGF0ZS9vYWt2Mj9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMTc1Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnByb2R1Y3RDb2RlPU5OJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE0NjkmdGU9MSZ1cmk9bnl0JTNBJTJGJTJGbmV3c2xldHRlciUyRjcwYzFjYzkzLTI4OWEtNTU3Yy05YzdhLTUzMmZmZTMzNTE2ZSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmRIkVFKZDtby7NSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]|nytimes.com\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/6iDRsQJS8HzdLqlc_AR9pg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0StaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTExNzUmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTQ2OSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZEiRUUpkO1vLs1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\n[https://static.nytimes.com/email-images/N-TheMorning%402x.png]\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nSUPPORTED BY Masterworks\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/ZrwfZPTzswNKb002zHofKQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP4Q_AWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3RlcndvcmtzLmNvbS8_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyNyZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MTE3NSZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxNDY5JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNSZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249NC0yNy0yMyZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1taWxsaW9ucytyZXR1cm5lZCthY2NvdW50X2N0YSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT10aGVtb3JuaW5nJnV0bV90ZXJtPXN1YnNjcmliZXIrb2YrVGhlK01vcm5pbmdXA255dEIKZEiRUUpkO1vLs1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\n\nAuthor Headshot\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/13/reader-center/author-german-lopez/author-german-lopez-blogSmallThumb-v2.png]https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ZAaYgAdK-ff3WTXaBtz1sg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0S8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYnkvZ2VybWFuLWxvcGV6P2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTExNzUmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTQ2OSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZEiRUUpkO1vLs1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~\n\nBy German Lopez\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ZAaYgAdK-ff3WTXaBtz1sg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0S8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYnkvZ2VybWFuLWxvcGV6P2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTExNzUmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTQ2OSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZEiRUUpkO1vLs1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\n\nGood morning. House Republicans are putting the economy at risk to push spending\ncuts.\n\n\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/27/multimedia/27themorning-lead-ljqt/27themorning-lead-ljqt-jumbo.jpg]Kevin\nMcCarthy, the House speaker.Kenny Holston/The New York Times\n\n\nCAPITAL SHOWDOWN\n\nSince they won a majority in the midterm elections, House Republicans have\npromised to use a debt-limit bill as leverage to achieve their policy\npriorities. But it was not until yesterday that they confirmed what those\npriorities are, passing legislation that they plan to use in debt-limit\nnegotiations.\n\nThe House approved the bill in a close vote, 217-215\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/3htg2yYdm9my-h-X8kZWQQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0TkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yNi91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9kZWJ0LWxpbWl0LXZvdGUtcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMTc1Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE0NjkmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmRIkVFKZDtby7NSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~],\nwith no Democratic support. The legislation, championed by House Speaker Kevin\nMcCarthy, would raise the limit on money the government can borrow through next\nyear, reel back President Biden’s climate agenda and force sweeping, unspecified\nspending cuts. The bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, which Democrats\ncontrol, and Biden has already said he would not sign it. But Republicans hope\nit will push Democrats to negotiate. “We lifted the debt limit; we’ve sent it to\nthe Senate; we’ve done our job,” McCarthy said.\n\nThe stakes are high. If the U.S. breaches the debt limit, it could be forced to\ndefault on its debts. A default could set off global economic calamity because\nU.S. debt, which underpins much of the financial system, would collapse in value\n(as I’ve explained before\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/3Q9-zjtGhuzUvjQpwtI44w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0ThaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8yMC9icmllZmluZy9kZWJ0LWxpbWl0LWRlZmF1bHQtY29uZ3Jlc3MuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMTc1Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE0NjkmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmRIkVFKZDtby7NSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]).\nThe U.S. hit the debt limit in January, but the Treasury Department has used\nso-called extraordinary measures to keep the government from defaulting. Those\nmeasures will run out in the coming months.\n\nRepublicans are leaning on the economic threat to try to force Democrats to\nnegotiate. Today’s newsletter will look at why Republicans are pursuing this\nstrategy and why Democrats see it as reckless.\n\n\nWHAT REPUBLICANS WANT\n\nRepublicans say the U.S. government has grown too large, that it spends too much\nand that its debt and deficits are unsustainable. More recently, Republicans\nhave argued that spending cuts will ease inflation. Reducing spending would also\ngive Republicans more leeway in the future to extend tax cuts passed under\nDonald Trump, which disproportionately benefited wealthy Americans.\n\nBut Republicans have failed to act on a smaller-government vision when they have\nbeen in power. When they controlled the House, Senate and White House in 2017\nand 2018, they increased federal spending and deficits. Pointing to that\nhistory, some liberals have argued\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/OH7Kkys0oa93g004f6h2hw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0TPaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9jaHJpc2xoYXllcy9zdGF0dXMvMTY1MTI2Nzc3MDQzMTAyOTI1Mj9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMTc1Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE0NjkmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmRIkVFKZDtby7NSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\nthat House Republicans are simply trying to undercut Biden even at the cost of\ndamaging the economy.\n\nRepublicans also face difficult politics. In the debt-limit showdown, they have\npromised to shield Social Security, Medicare and military spending from cuts.\nThose programs make up the bulk of federal spending. Without them, balancing the\nbudget or even just reducing spending would require steep cuts to other\npolicies, potentially including Medicaid, food stamps, border security and\ngrants to local police departments.\n\nSome of those programs are popular, and slashing them could upset constituents\nwho rely on them to make ends meet.\n\nThe political reality has prompted Republicans to take smaller steps.\nOriginally, McCarthy said he wanted to put the U.S. “on a path towards a\nbalanced budget” within 10 years. His current proposal\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/MEu3mGCNgYFouOx-UWj44A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0TjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yMC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9yZXB1YmxpY2FuLWRlYnQtbGltaXQtYmlsbC5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTExNzUmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTQ2OSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZEiRUUpkO1vLs1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nfalls short of that goal. But it would cap some federal spending,\nreclaim unspent Covid relief funds, roll back the Biden administration’s efforts\nto boost clean energy, block student loan forgiveness and impose more stringent\nwork requirements for food stamps and Medicaid.\n\n\nWHY DEMOCRATS REFUSE\n\nDemocrats have largely resisted negotiating over the debt limit. They have\nlikened Republicans’ tactics to hostage taking, arguing that McCarthy and his\nallies are using the threat of economic catastrophe to force Biden to agree to\ndraconian spending cuts. Democrats warn that negotiating would set a bad\nprecedent — one that could ultimately hurt Republican administrations, too.\nDemocrats could, for example, refuse to raise the debt limit to try to force a\nRepublican president to agree to increase the minimum wage.\n\nBut there is already precedent. Barack Obama’s administration negotiated with\nRepublicans during similar debt-limit showdowns. Some Democrats, including\nthen-Senator Biden, also voted against increasing the debt limit in 2006 to\nprotest the costs of the Iraq war and tax cuts.\n\nBiden and his allies argue that it is time to break that cycle. They say they\nwill negotiate with Republicans on spending after they increase the debt limit,\nbut not before. This matches what other countries do. (Denmark is the only other\ncountry with a similar debt limit, but it raises its cap well in advance of\nreaching it.)\n\nDemocrats also object to Republicans’ proposed cuts, which they say would\nparticularly hurt poor and middle-class Americans. They also point out that some\nproposals, like reducing funding for the I.R.S.\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/l449Gc3DrbDfzxa3kEUasg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLNaRP0TlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNi9icmllZmluZy9jb25zcGlyYWN5LWlycy10YXgtYWdlbmN5LWZyYXVkLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyNyZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MTE3NSZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxNDY5JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkSJFRSmQ7W8uzUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA],\nwould increase the deficit.\n\nStill, Democrats may be forced to negotiate.

The place in between.\n\nI have seen limbs of prickly pear hovering in the still, hot air,\n\nclustered and distorted like a reef in reverse.\n\nI have seen the hay bales lead me to ranch houses\n\nwith tin foil winks on every window\n\nand a museum of appliances on every porch,\n\nsliding from one world to another,\n\nwhere there are trucks without wheels,\n\nwillows without spirits, and mesquites with nothing to lose.\n\n\nI have seen the sun own the land. I have seen it bake\n\ninto our hands. And I have seen it sleep in a dark coverlet\n\nwhile the sky opens loose, and the coyotes, in their constellation,\n\npropose a trick. A star crosses with intelligence.\n\nA rabbit becomes an antique. At the gas station in Cotulla,\n\nI eat the moon in the form of a pie. A real U.F.O. in cellophane,\n\na chemically unctuous sweet. Each bite, with the physics of an asteroid,\n\ncrumbles onto the asphalt where purpling black spheres of gum\n\nhave each staked a claim on the cosmos. There is no claim\n\nthat cannot be shifted. There is no orbit that cannot be redone.\n\nI have a stepfather who I call a father, who believes other life forms\n\nare out there, far beyond our boastful sun. And I have seen\n\nthis moon pie has no bloodline.

Or at least Americans used\nto feel that way.\n\nIn 2002, 50 percent of adults said that they had a lot of confidence in the\ncourt, according to Gallup’s annual polls on major institutions. Last year, in\nthe most recent version of the poll, only 25 percent gave that answer. Other\ninstitutions have also become less trusted over the past two decades, but the\ncourt’s decline has been especially acute.\n\nThe Supreme Court is now less trusted than organized religion, organized labor\nor public schools, as this chart from my colleague Ashley Wu shows:\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/17/briefing/oakImage-1681757098250/oakImage-1681757098250-jumbo.png]Source:\nGallup | By The New York Times\n\nThe debate over Justice Clarence Thomas’s acceptance of gifts\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ebEnW5iH4uJItwix5jwl2g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIPvNP0TwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xMy91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9jbGFyZW5jZS10aG9tYXMtaGFybGFuLWNyb3ctcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE4Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNDYxJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA3MTEmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQhzXY-ZNWMeMBSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\nfrom a wealthy Republican donor — and Thomas’s failure to disclose them — is in\nsome ways a political Rorschach test. Many liberals who already disliked Thomas\nare angry. Many conservatives who consider Thomas to be a great justice think\nthe controversy is overblown. And given that justices have lifetime tenure, that\nthe Supreme Court has a habit of protecting its own, and that Congress (which\nhas the power to remove justices) is gridlocked, I don’t expect that this\nepisode will lead to any direct consequences for Thomas.\n\nBut it may have larger political consequences.\n\nThomas has engaged in a yearslong pattern of behaving in ways that other\njustices, and many elected politicians, do not. He has misled the public\nmultiple times\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/-_mG-0NTiYJkDp_UNDFlWA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIPvNP0TRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxMS8wMS8yNS91cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yNXRob21hcy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MTgmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTA0NjEmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMDcxMSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZCHNdj5k1Yx4wFIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nabout his finances (accidentally, he has said). His wife, Virginia, a\nconservative activist, has also acted in ways that affect the court’s\ncredibility. She attended the Jan. 6 rally protesting the 2020 election result\nand has repeated Donald Trump’s false claims about that election.\n\nOutside legal experts aren’t the only ones worried about the court’s reputation\nthese days. The justices are, too.\n\nJohn Roberts, the chief justice, has publicly argued that the court is not part\nof the country’s “polarized political environment.” Amy Coney Barrett gave a\nspeech in which she said that she and her colleagues were not “a bunch of\npartisan hacks.” Thomas himself has said that the justices don’t decide cases\nbased on “personal preference.”\n\nThomas’s own behavior, however, has made it harder for the court to argue that\nit follows a loftier standard than either Congress or the executive branch does.\nMany officials in those branches probably would have suffered damage to their\ncareers if they had repeatedly covered up — or failed to disclose — payments\nthey had received.\n\nYou have to wonder how Thomas’s colleagues, including his fellow conservatives,\nfeel about the continuing revelations.\n\nIn the rest of today’s newsletter, my colleague Lauren Jackson explains the\nsituation, including the latest developments and less recent details.\n\n\nYACHT TRIPS\n\nProPublica has reported this month\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/y26ZAB1frf3uARp5Ic0rsQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIPvNP0TzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJvcHVibGljYS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jbGFyZW5jZS10aG9tYXMtc2NvdHVzLXVuZGlzY2xvc2VkLWx1eHVyeS10cmF2ZWwtZ2lmdHMtY3Jvdz9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE4Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNDYxJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA3MTEmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQhzXY-ZNWMeMBSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\non two aspects of Thomas’s relationship with a real estate scion from Dallas\nnamed Harlan Crow, who has spent millions of dollars on Republican causes,\nincluding efforts to move the judiciary to the right.

After that story, Thomas\ncontinued to accept gifts but stopped disclosing them in the public forms that\nSupreme Court justices file annually. More recent gifts remained unknown until\nProPublica’s reporting.\n\nAmong them: Thomas has flown on Crow’s private jet and toured a volcanic\nIndonesian archipelago on his superyacht. Crow commissioned a portrait of\nhimself and Thomas smoking cigars in Adirondack chairs.

Of course,\n\nthe absence of bees\nleft behind significant holes\nin ecology. Less\n\nobvious\nwere the indelible holes\nin poems, which would come\nlater:\n\nOur vast psychic habitat\nshrunk.

Nobody came home\n\nand yelled   honey!   up the stairs,\n\nAnd nothing in particular\nby any other name would smell as sweet as—\n\nConsider:\nthe verbal dearth\nthat is always a main ripple of extinction.\n\nThe lexicon of wilds goes on nixing its descriptions.\nSlimming its index of references\nfor what is\n\nsuper as a rhubarb, and juicy\nas a peach,\nor sunken as a\ncomb and ancient as an alder tree, or\nconifer, or beech, what is royal\nas jelly, dark as a wintering\n\nhive, toxic as the jessamine vine\nwho weeps the way a willow does,\nsilently as wax\nburned in the land of milk and\n\nall the strong words in poems,\nthey were once\n\nsmeared on the mandible of a bee.\n\nCopyright © 2023 by RK Fauth.

Established in 2019 with generous support from Treehouse Investments, the prize is given to honor exceptional poems that help make real for readers the gravity of the vulnerable state of our environment at present. Beginning with Earth Day, Poem-a-Day will feature this year’s three winners on consecutive weekends.\n\n“Making language itself a primary concern, ‘Playing with Bees’ reminds us that we are nature, just as bees are, and the poem explores the manner in which words govern our relationship with the nonhuman world. Inside that exploration, this poem becomes a poignant meditation on how we imagine both the natural world and our place within it, while also capturing some of the mystery of what exists beyond our ability to express. ”\n—Dr. Peter Kalmus and Matthew Olzmann (https://poets.org/poet/matthew-olzmann?mc_cid=88cebd421e&mc_eid=UNIQID)\n\n“This poem is the prelude to my first collection, Playing with Bees, which catalogs moments in time as artifacts after a fictional bee extinction. The image (https://poets.org/glossary/imagery?mc_cid=88cebd421e&mc_eid=UNIQID) of ‘the world turning its one good eye’ came to me after watching a swarm of starlings. The birds made these mesmerizing, intelligent patterns against a sunset undoubtedly made extra vibrant by light pollution. It made me wonder, what happens to my imagination, my language, my daydreams, every time a peg in the environment is removed? Without, say, bees, what of this poem would shrivel and disappear? How much of me would the bees take with them?”\n—RK Fauth\nhttps://poets.org/poet/rk-fauth?mc_cid=88cebd421e&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nRK Fauth (https://poets.org/poet/rk-fauth?mc_cid=88cebd421e&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of A Dream in Which I Am Playing with Bees (Texas Tech University Press, 2024), winner of the Walt MacDonald First Book Prize in Poetry.

Thursday 4/20 - 11:15 am to 12:30 pm, SEC 1.413","text":"\n\nFrom: Demba Ba\n\n\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n\n\nI hope this message finds you well and in great health.\n\nMy friend and colleague George Barbastathis from MIT will speak to my class this Thursday! You may find the topic of high relevance to AI4Science! You can find details below.\n\n\n\nTitle: Adjoint sensitivities and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Nodes)\n\n\n\nRoom: SEC 1.413. From 11:15 am to 12:30 pm\n\n\n\nAbstract: In March 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic was starting, many students in the (then budding) Physics in Machine Learning class at MIT were selecting projects relating to epidemiological analysis and forecasting. One of them, Raj Dandekar, decided to look into the effect of quarantine, namely how it influences the rate of infections. At the time, he and his advisor, Chris Rackauckas, were involved in the origins of a new class of algorithms allowing the direct insertion of neural networks into differential equations for system identification, forecasting, and control. The result was one of the first-ever practical implementations of Nodes, and yielded some interesting insights into how different policies among jurisdictions affected their infection outcomes [Dandekar et al, Patterns 1:100145, 2020; Dandekar et al, Health Data Science 2021:9798302]. Since then, Nodes has been applied widely in many contexts of estimation theory, including stiff nonlinear dynamics [Suyong Kim, et al, Chaos 31:093122, 2021].\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, we will start at the motivation behind Nodes more generally and the Covid-19 work more specifically. Then we will go into the nitty-gritty of such techniques in simple dynamics such as the Malthusian and logistic population growth models, and the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey competition model. We will learn how the important concept of adjoint sensitivity arises in these models in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Finally, we will loop back into the original idea of inserting neural networks into differential equations, and how the adjoint allows the weights of these networks to be estimated, building robust and explainable models of complex phenomena.\n\nFamiliarity with nonlinear dynamics will be helpful, but not required; however, we will all have to dust up our memories of simple ordinary differential equations.\n\nBio: George and his groups at MIT and in Singapore are defining the role of machine learning far beyond applications in imaging and optics by elegantly weaving first principles into the AI's learning functionals. George's work demonstrates clearly how the synergies between physics, first principles, and machine learning will enable strategic research priorities in engineering and the sciences. His educational efforts model elegantly how to excite our students about the utility of first principles-enabled machine learning in science and engineering.\n\nFamiliarity with nonlinear dynamics will be helpful, but not required; however, we will all have to dust up our memories of simple ordinary differential equations.\n\n\n\nHost: Demba Ba\n\nThank you very much,\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D971F3.97C8EF60]\nLiz Palomino (she/her/hers)\nFaculty Coordinator\nHarvard John A.

So what if a couple\nof its squishy parts are suspended\nwithin, like beach-bungled jellyfish\nin a shelved jar, not doing anything?\nNothing on this side of the quantum\ntunnel is perfect. The splendid body,\nthough, is splendid in the way\nit keeps its steamy blood in, no matter\nhow bad it blushes. And splendid\nin how it opens its mouth and\nthese invisible vibrations come\nrippling out—if you put your wrist\nright up to it when that happens\nit feels somewhat like the feet\nof many bees. The splendid body\nloves the juniper smell of gin, loves\nthe warmth of printer-fresh paper,\nand the sound fallen leaves make\nunder the wheel of a turning car.\nIf you touch it between the legs,\nthe splendid body will quicken\nlike bubbles in a just-on teakettle.\nIt knows it can’t exist forever, so\nit’s collecting as many flavors as it can—\nsaffron, rainwater, fish-skin, chive.\nDo not distract it from its purpose,\nwhich is to feel everything it can find.\n\nCopyright © 2023 by Rebecca Lindenberg.

That project began during the Covid-19 lockdown, because, everywhere I looked, I saw the words ‘diabetes’ and ‘severe outcome’ within an inch of each other on page after page of news, public service announcements, medical studies, etc. As a Type 1 diabetic for over thirty years now, I found that scary and distracting. That, in turn, prompted me to write more directly about my experience growing up with an incurable, life-threatening illness and the way it’s shaped my life, my imagination, and, in turn, my art and other ways I have of knowing. I see this particular poem as examining the ways in which chronic disease prevents us from taking the body and its intersections with the world for granted. Usually, that’s one of the hardest things about living with my condition; but it can, at times, feel almost celebratory.”\n—Rebecca Lindenberg\nhttp://poets.org/poet/rebecca-lindenberg?mc_cid=21c40f16f5&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nRebecca Lindenberg (http://poets.org/poet/rebecca-lindenberg?mc_cid=21c40f16f5&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of Our Splendid Failure to Do the Impossible, forthcoming in 2024 from BOA Editions.

We are headed for a future in which it will no longer be necessary to write computer programs. Matt believes that most software will eventually be replaced by AI models that, given an appropriate description of a task, will directly execute that task, without requiring the creation or maintenance of conventional software. In effect, large language models act as a virtual machine that is \"programmed\" in natural language. This talk will explore the implications of this prediction, drawing on recent research into the cognitive and task execution capabilities of large language models.  \n\nDuration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&A)\n\nPresenter:\nMatt Welsh, CEO, Fixie.ai\n\nMatt Welsh is the CEO and Co-founder of Fixie.ai, a Seattle-based startup developing a new computational platform with AI at the core. He was previously head of engineering at OctoML, a software engineer at Apple and Xnor.ai, engineering director at Google, and a Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. He holds a PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nModerator:\nOana Olteanu, Partner, SignalFire\n\nOana is a ML engineer with operating experience in enterprise software and investment experience at the Seed, Series A and Series B stages. Prior to joining SignalFire, Oana was at Scale Venture Partners where she invested in applied ML and developer tooling. She sourced Scale's investments in Observe.ai, Flatfile, and Proscia.

Below is a short description of her venture:\n\nWishWise is a wishlist and personal finance service that incentivizes users to save money before making a purchase, whether it's a new article of clothing or an electronic device. The key component of WishWise is the browser extension that pops up when users add items to an online shopping cart. They'll be nudged to put the item in WishWise's cart, rather than the actual website's cart, and set a savings goal. WishWise would also have a social community aspect, where users can find friends and see each other's wishlist or saving trends.

Such extensions are at the discretion of the instructor; there is no need for Administrative Board action.

You must petition the Administrative Board for an official extension of time beyond the exam period; such extensions are not guaranteed and are given only in extenuating circumstances. Please note that the notation “Incomplete” (INC), often used in the grading of graduate students, cannot be given to undergraduates. You should be in touch with Chip (mailto:adamshousedean@fas.harvard.edu)  as soon as possible if you think you may need to petition for an extension of time beyond May 13.\n\nFor more details about extensions, please see the DSO's Getting Support site (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__harvard.us2.list-2Dmanage.com_track_click-3Fu-3D62ffd980490ab72203ab03a9a-26id-3Dbff13ffd5f-26e-3D921394253b&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=i4KiN2_An3SlxToPziKbx-XYN4qn68LlioB_w5S2UcCxZL8naaj_AJTAfeeJQVAU&m=-FuVZjJw-ieb5xaBBFl-pHmlhm03kESFF4ULMgC8Xwm-CyFMTvFy97O6hCaW7Pdx&s=69BBxCW4myd62bjJZTKgGCdtVMEBHY3rV3nxZi0zB2A&e=) .\nCheck your Final Exam Schedule\nPlease take a moment to check your final exam schedule (https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/take-exams) before making any end-of-term travel plans, and make sure you don't have any conflicts between your exams.

That image (https://poets.org/glossary/imagery?mc_cid=1a0759482b&mc_eid=UNIQID) became the poem’s first layer, and from there I explored different ideas and terms about climate change, each with its own definition. I found them all trying to translate the same experience: existing in a dying world. So the poem’s use of the colon is informed by those attempts at defining and translating the looking that we do through small windows and the way we encounter our vulnerability over and over again.”\n—Jake Skeets\nhttps://poets.org/poet/jake-skeets?mc_cid=1a0759482b&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nJake Skeets (https://poets.org/poet/jake-skeets?mc_cid=1a0759482b&mc_eid=UNIQID) is a Diné poet and the author of Eyes Bottle Dark with a Mouthful of Flowers (Milkweed Editions, 2018), winner of the National Poetry Series.

Originally from Poland, Lidia has been a long-serving Supervisor in Cabot Library. She is outstanding and known by many of the student workers that she supervises as \"Grandma\". Her charm and her service have radiated the walls of Cabot Library, and she is well-loved by her colleagues and students alike. Her presence continues to grace the popular study spot for Harvard College students.  \n\n\nHow long have you worked at Cabot Library?\nI have worked at Cabot Library for the last 40 years, and these have been the most fulfilling years of my life. \n\nWith such a long service at Cabot Library, what are some of your fondest memories?\nMy fondest memories have been, and will always be, the students. Seeing students come here as first-years and seeing them grow up and become great people in society during and after their time at Harvard always makes me smile. My fondest memories are with my colleagues who are student-workers. I have worked with, and supervised, countless students, and joked with them, disagreed with them, agreed with them, and thanked them for the last four decades, and seeing them succeed is always my greatest satisfaction. Also, serving students at the circulation desk for such a long time has allowed me to interact with the best of people. \n\nYou've talked extensively about student workers; What impact do you think their jobs have?\nThanks for asking this question. I have worked with countless students who are on financial aid, and I must say that the financial aid today to Harvard College students is phenomenal. Many of my supervisees have many a time confided to me how the pay that they get from jobs such as in Cabot Circulation services goes a long way to help them live more comfortably, and offset many unwritten expenses, while also gaining invaluable experience in student jobs, of which at least for Cabot, I categorize as public service. \n\nWhat do you think has contributed to your exemplary service for such a long time to Harvard?\nI don't like talking about myself, but I think that just being a decent and normal human being with humanity has been instrumental in my service. I treat my supervisees as my equals, even if they fondly call me \"grandma\" out of respect, and I value every person that I interact with, including everyone that I serve on the circulation desk. I also see a bright future with every Harvard affiliate that I interact with, and being a part of their success makes me happy to serve them in any way and as long as I humanly can. \n\nWhat is your hope for the future of the libraries at Harvard?\nI hope that students can see the value in the millions of books that we have at Harvard. While technology has made things easier over the 40 years that I have worked in this library, I believe in the value of taking a physical book from the library, even if not required for class, and reading it out there in the sun, or in your break, or in public transportation to just enrich your knowledge and appreciation for study. I hope students continue to realize the treasure that they have in Harvard's countless books, and I hope that Harvard libraries continue serving students and scholars in the exemplary way that they have been doing. \n \n\nHFAI Newsletter Submissions\n\nHave something you want to see in the HFAI newsletter?

These poems are a gift.&rdquo; - Richarda E. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a writer, old houses are more than quaint. They send the imagination down the corridors of time. What did the children dream of? Which songs were sung? What stories did the elders share? What sadness fell upon their souls and how did they tend to their wounds?       \n\n   \n&mdash; Major\n\nTo the Buyer of Our Old Home\n by Helen Pruitt Wallace\n\n\n\nWe can tell you, if you want, which doors creak,\n\n\n      or windows that need to be re-glazed, which faucet\n\n\nhas a tendency to leak, and where a wine glass\n\n\n      left a halo etched in the counter&rsquo;s travertine.\n\n\nAnd we could share which walls absorb sadness,\n\n\n      till morning light leans in comforting the contours\n\n\nof the bed, but chances are you&rsquo;ll learn this\n\n\n      on your own. There&rsquo;s the cough of the AC kicking on,\n\n\nand the hiss of the heater turning off, and a crack\n\n\n      in the plaster by the stairs. You&rsquo;ll study it at times\n\n\nas metaphor, disaster creeping like the bifurcated lines\n\n\n      of your palm. But then again, maybe you won&rsquo;t....\n\n\nLet&rsquo;s go outside.\n\n \n\n\nThe doorbell never works when it rains. And the riot\n\n\n      of white gardenias blooming now is always late.\n\n\nA black snake burrows through ferns, and a cardinal\n\n\n      spends days hurling himself against our bare window.\n\n\nWe say our, but it&rsquo;s your house now. Our beloved dog\n\n\n      was buried over there&mdash;along with his chew toys\n\n\nand bones. And at night our kids&rsquo; laughter carries\n\n\n      through the courtyard of the home (though they\n\n\nmoved out some years ago). And this large oak&mdash;\n\n\n      what can we say? Old limbs keep falling even when no\n\n\nwind stirs. The tree is gone. We sold because we couldn&rsquo;t\n\n\n      chop it down. Still, we hear the woodpecker crazed\n\n\nas the leaves turn brown.\n\n\"To the Buyer of Our Old Home\" by Helen Pruitt Wallace.

You wake up one day.\n\nYou look in the mirror. You have grown a thick skin, and the \n\nyou in the mirror is no longer you. One day, in the third period \n\non the first day of class, you decide to change your name to\n\nTom. You do not care for the name, not in the slightest. It is\n\neasy to spell. It is easy to say. You will have plenty of time to \n\nregret your choices. It is just a thing, you tell yourself. You\n\ncarry these things. They are placed on you. They are thrown at\n\nyou. You walk through life.

Last quarter, Microsoft missed sales expectations as PC and cloud demand cooled. Google disappointed as YouTube ads sagged. And despite Meta&#39;s cost slashing, analysts expect it to report its sixth straight quarter of declining profit. Tech stocks have jumped this year on hopes that the Fed would start cutting rates, but it may not be enough for a profit rebound.</p><p><strong>Next stop…</strong> cleanup. <strong><a href=\"https://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHk6R8tCrM-2FUICq73HMQolwWswJcGwHYV0pkr7nO0-2BjhDWTJ8_Iu9rcH71-2BW1bGQWB3N5FwWyP2HRRla-2Bj8ThZMHqaTeC4Hy3SOluvGV3S1xINcAu3biRYg3aUu-2Fb497I9ZYUfG5mLfMU42We-2BYIdwu0rNdBpzB7t5Lyng5I60jAWQumk2ZNb133V9T5wklXtlaUmYd3EpkeRXRD7CkjE13PE07m09f3B3jyn18Gq8L83UAUJzhVOgji2v-2BZThSe6FqsigTjvVNmODYB9QyC-2FTX0cw6XmEMevtauNI-2BYf-2BDojEn7hK5SfvSTIrtHn3CVC6jvUULyU15MKwozoxcDN6v6IO-2FMxuuNOs6u1kfm9zaG5mD-2B-2B3l91VarbYuDTufH0BgFaonVR7kaAJyM6hpOCrgBCxC8ouM5FHtyPb2KtjDbTpjGIbfJqXPx2z0WE2EecOhgLNkfrXhlmg04KfjqowQkp6UQkPDgtlpFb5Tr9ageYy4NW-2BaeRhrkeLQxufSFU9k5SIRG3r0t1xcnaMYQEqibnXO5JDmb5fn9WJhccP5h-2B72LfWNlvS8UY6fOhW4BCdnSORsMsIUsQkB9lpnAn1UXs9wwQv8i-2FpjU15tzK30p-2FkacEBzJjUqJ4NqtWEiqxlKdcY1i6q20xkYb6RihS5gaemAESCOTSu8tfyshOS3qJndy9jcNMXQ6Tkaisvc1DdO5o-2FZfmD6bHlhMfT5Gp4eh0gIaw-3D style=\"color: #26A19B; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; text-decoration-thickness: 2px; text-underline-offset: 1px;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Norfolk Southern</a></strong> will report for the first time since one of its trains derailed in Ohio in February.

For this year’s application cycle, applicants must have obtained their Ph.D. between March 1st, 2018, and March 31st, 2023.

Belief in ghosts is something I grew up with. The Alabama of my girlhood was red dirt roads and abandoned houses where not much but the chimney was still left standing. That’s where the ghosts of my girlhood live. This poem originates from the folk belief that when one dies someone should go out and tell the beehive because bees are messengers that carry the news of your death to the gods.”\n—Ansel Elkins\nhttps://poets.org/poet/ansel-elkins?mc_cid=f2d56e0e04&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nAnsel Elkins (https://poets.org/poet/ansel-elkins?mc_cid=f2d56e0e04&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of Blue Yodel (Yale University Press, 2015), winner of the Yale Younger Poets Prize.

Here's how it will work:\n\n*Now - April 28: Candidacy declarations*\n\n   - If you want to run for a position, please fill out *this form*\n   <https://forms.gle/cbUtEJwMF2B1xFQU7> and provide a brief statement on\n   why you are running, which we will share with the club during the voting\n   period. You may run for multiple positions; just provide a statement for\n   each position.\n   - To run, you must be planning to be an enrolled student for the\n   entirety of the 2023-2024 academic year and you must have attended at least\n   two meetings over the past two semesters.\n   - The co-presidents reach out to guest speakers, communicate with the\n   club, plan events, and generally oversee things. The treasurer gets funding\n   from the HUA, buys stuff, and keeps a record of financial transactions. The\n   secretary controls media and outreach activities.\n   - You're encouraged to run for anything you're interested in!\n   - Please feel free to contact anyone on the board if you have questions.\n   - If you're free at our meeting tomorrow, feel free to do some light\n   campaigning :)\n\n*April 29 - May 1: Voting period*\n\n   - Once the candidacy declaration period is over, we will email out the\n   candidates' statements to the whole club.\n   - All members will then be able to read the statements and vote on the\n   new board. Each member may, of course, only vote once.\n\n*May 2: Election results*\n\n   - On May 2, we will make the results public and announce our board for\n   next year.\n   - If there is a tie, we will have a run-off election.\n\nBest,\nJoanna (the only graduating board member, and therefore your impartial\nparliamentarian)\n"}],"1398366807":[{"date":"2023-04-27T09:30:59.000Z","subject":"Why is wellness trending this Mother’s Day?

The\npurpose is to donate clothes, accessories, dorm decor, etc, that you won't\nwant for next year instead of throwing it away or into a giant donation bin\nat the end of the year. The most sustainable option is to give items to be\ndirectly reused in a new home since we know it's a guarantee it won't end\nup in a landfill. Whatever doesn't get grabbed at the item swap will be\ndirectly donated to local shelters. Bring one, take one policy encouraged.\nFor more details, check my previous emails!\n\nDonate your stuff to it ahead of time at Carpe for raffle tickets, in the\nbox in the Lower Common Room, and the box in the Clav ground floor by the\nbiig staircase! If you can't drop off your stuff at those times, you can\ndrop by at 10AM in the Atrium or reach out to me! It's important to get\nthis stuff in ahead of time so the Gradams Market team and I can set up the\nAtrium for you in time!\n\nCome to divert stuff from landfills, get free stuff, have Felipe's and\nfresh berries, get a chance to participate in the raffle, and enjoy the\ncommunity!\n\n*Now... what's in this raffle I keep mentioning?*\n*PIES*\n\nThat's right -- a bunch of the tutors agreed to get pied in the face early\nlast year if we won the Green Cup to encourage participation. The official\nlist of tutors who may have pies (kindly) thrown at them is...\n\nSanti, Varnel, Shandra, Shannon, Michael, Ryan, Danielle, John (and feed\nOshie some whipped cream!), and Alex!\n\n*Want to be the one pie-ing one of the tutors? Participate in Gradams\nMarket! Every donation will get you a raffle ticket! Winners will be drawn\nduring Gradams Market and notified to make sure they don't miss out! *Yes,\nI am still using the pie-ing to motivate the house to engage with\nsustainability one last time before I graduate (humor me here Gradams <3)\n*This could be you:*\n[image: face pie.gif]\n\nIf you want a raffle ticket but cannot make it to Carpe or the morning of\n22nd, shoot me a message and I'll arrange a ticket for you!

In this community conversation, students from the “Storytelling:\nHazards and Possibilities” study group will engage with guests in a\ndiscussion exploring the lived experience of growing up in a New England\nmill town, what it means to stay there, and what happens when you leave.\nTogether, the roundtable will explore questions of community, ecology, and\ninequality in America.\n\n\n\n*Kerri Arsenault* is the 2022-23 American Democracy Fellow, co-sponsored by\nthe Charles Warren Center and the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship.\n\n*Maddy Arsenault* is Kerri’s mother and a longtime resident of Mexico;* Jim\nAylward* is the guidance counselor and former Head Coach of the high school\nfootball team at Mountain Valley High; *Marie Therese *(*Terry) Martin* is\nthe author of *WHEN POISON FELL FROM THE SKY* and a nurse; and *Lisa\nRussell* teaches high school math in Rumford.\n\n\n\nThe roundtable will be facilitated by undergraduate student discussants *Alex\nWhite* (’23, Government and Public Policy), *Jana Amin* (’25), and *Katie\nCatulle *(’24, English), *Aeden Marcus* ('25, Environmental Science,\nEngineering), and *Eshan Vishwakarma *('26).\n\nThis event is sponsored by the *Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship*.\n\n\n\n*The Harvard University media relations policy outlines that the press is\nnot permitted to film or cover events on campus.

Even dedicated fans have grumbled in recent years\nabout games being longer and less exciting. To an extent, M.L.B. executives say\nthey agree, and they believe that this year’s rule changes will help.\n\nSo far, they are right. The changes — including the pitch clock and others meant\nto increase action — have led to much faster games with more hits, more stolen\nbases and less down time. Whether the changes will increase interest in baseball\nis another question.\n\nToday’s newsletter will explore how different this new version of baseball\nreally is, with some charts from my colleague Ashley Wu.\n\n\nA QUICKER GAME\n\nWhen it comes to game duration — the amount of time between the first pitch and\nthe last — M.L.B.’s new rules have been a smashing success.\n\nFor decades, outings at the ballpark had been getting longer and longer. When\nBabe Ruth played in the 1920s, nine innings of play lasted less than two hours.\nOver time, as it became more common for at-bats to last longer\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/oXAmmQiVXgvWufTI5gPD0w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmJ53kP0TQaHR0cHM6Ly9zYWJyLm9yZy9qb3VybmFsL2FydGljbGUvd2h5LWRvLWdhbWVzLXRha2Utc28tbG9uZy8_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyMyZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MDg4MCZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxMTUwJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkPuQYRWT8HVKnUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA],\nthe average game time ticked up. It ultimately peaked at 3 hours 11 minutes in\n2021.\n\nThat trend has sharply reversed this year.\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/20/briefing/23-the-morning-baseball-1/oakImage-1682014179916-jumbo.png]Sources:\nRetrosheet; Baseball Reference | Data is through the first three weeks of\u0003each\nseason. | By The New York Times\n\nDuring the first three weeks of this season, games lasted 2 hours 39 minutes on\naverage — 29 fewer minutes than they did during the same time frame last year.\nThat means at a typical game beginning at 7:05 p.m., fans are heading home\naround 9:45 p.m. instead of 10:15 p.m. It also means that all of the runs, hits,\nstrikeouts and errors occur during a shorter period of time, making the game\nfeel more action-packed.\n\nThe time reduction can be mostly credited to the implementation of the pitch\nclock. Here’s how it works: After a pitcher receives the ball at the mound, a\n15-second clock starts to count down (20 if a runner is on base). If the pitcher\nwaits too long, the umpire calls a ball as a penalty; if the batter delays, the\numpire calls a strike. The timer means that at-bats now move faster — though\nfans who are scrolling through social media or are in line for a hot dog are now\nmore likely to miss something.\n\n“I felt like I was at warp speed,” New York Mets pitcher David Robertson said\nafter his first appearance this year.\n\n\nMORE ACTION\n\nThe second, and more important, goal that baseball is trying to achieve with its\nnew rules is to make the games more entertaining.\n\nThe M.L.B. commissioner, Rob Manfred, told my colleague Michael Schmidt\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/lKEalHzMzZD4wNDT7-p4hQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmJ53kP0TmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8zMC9wb2RjYXN0cy90aGUtZGFpbHkvbWxiLW5ldy1ydWxlcy1ob21lLXJ1bi5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjMmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTA4ODAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTE1MCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD7kGEVk_B1Sp1IfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nthat baseball’s problems were at least partly a result of the sport’s recent\nobsession with analytics. Teams over the past two decades have raced for a\nstatistical edge: They use more pitchers, and those pitchers throw faster, while\nbatters have tuned their swings to hit the long ball — leading to more\nstrikeouts and more home runs, but fewer balls hit in play.\n\n“Baseball changed,” Manfred said. “Fans wanted the game to look like the way it\nused to look like.”\n\nThe sport’s new rules, including requirements about where certain defensive\nplayers can stand, were designed to increase the game’s action — and\nentertainment value — with more hits, more steals and more impressive defensive\nplays. Through the first three weeks of the year, the M.L.B. has gotten the\nresult it hoped for: Runners are stealing more bases, runs are up and batting\naverage has risen modestly compared with the same period last season.\n\nAn increased leaguewide batting average, up to .247 from .231 last year, means\nthat at-bats more often end with a hit now. Statistically, it’s a significant\njump from last year’s historic low, though hits are still less common than they\nwere in the mid-2000s.\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/20/briefing/23-the-morning-baseball-2/oakImage-1682016475246-jumbo.png]Sources:\nRetrosheet; Baseball Reference | Data is through the first three weeks of\u0003each\nseason. | By The New York Times\n\nThough the changes have already had an impact, they still may not be enough to\nsolve baseball’s troubles.

While you're enjoying the sunshine and flowers, check out new research from SEAS.\n\n\n** RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**\nBIOENGINEERING\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* Prof. Conor Walsh's group and a team of researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) developed a soft robotic wearable (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=98e7ffdccd&e=65d2b2b7c0) capable of significantly assisting upper arm and shoulder movement in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n* In 2017, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells were green-lit as the first modified therapeutic cells by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to treat leukemia. However, not all patients respond equally well to CAR-T cell therapies, and cancer immunologists have been trying to figure out what makes them work well or fail. Collaborators from SEAS and the Wyss Institute, led by Prof. David Mooney, as well as cancer immunologists from Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, have demonstrated that personalizing CAR-T cell stimulation during manufacturing can significantly enhance the consistency and potency of the resulting CAR-T cell products (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=cb9c409e1f&e=65d2b2b7c0) .\n* A paper by Prof. Joost Vlassak revealed that previous estimates of the amount of energy expended by cell structures have been off by a factor of a billion. Working with Prof. Daniel Needleman, researchers deployed a unique pico-calorimetry method to analyze energy in microtubules and skeletal cell filaments, parts of cells that are crucial for determining cell shape, motions, and more.\n\n\n** APPLIED PHYSICS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* This cascaded-mode resonator, developed by Prof. Federico Capasso and his group, creates a supermode resonance (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=90a5e3068c&e=65d2b2b7c0) by reflecting the light back in a different mode at each reflection.\n* Prof. Capasso's lab also unveiled a nanofabrication technique that uses holes to vacuum guide extreme ultraviolet light (EUV) (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=710952b46c&e=65d2b2b7c0) . Metalens derived from this fabrication will transform the semiconducting industry and allow for applications not even invented yet.\n\n\n** ENVIRONMENT\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* Prof. Daniel Jacob is helping policymakers determine existing methane emissions (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=dd46b824b8&e=65d2b2b7c0) in order to support research and policy initiatives battling climate change.\n\n\n** COMPUTER SCIENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* Artificially intelligent neural networks typically rely on on visual facial and object libraries that are lacking diverse socioeconomic and demographic representation. Prof. Vijay Reddi, along with machine learning researchers and collaborators from MLCommons and Coactive AI, created a more diverse dataset using pictures of objects found in households around the world (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=f027e61852&e=65d2b2b7c0) and trained a neural network to sort objects based on that dataset.\n\n\n** FEATURED VIDEO\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=cef143c948&e=65d2b2b7c0\nResearchers from SEAS and the Wyss Institute have developed a rotational multimaterial 3D printing method for creating helical filaments (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=798ff3c0e8&e=65d2b2b7c0) . Using this new approach, the team, led by Prof. Jennifer Lewis, designed and fabricated artificial muscles and springy lattices for use in soft robotics and structural applications.\n\n\n** BACKSTORY\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProf. Steven Wofsy isn't ready to retire just yet. He, along with scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund and the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, are gearing up to launch MethaneSAT early next year. MethaneSAT is a methane-sensing satellite that will allow scientists to track emissions to their sources and provide key data for reduction efforts. (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=e67d23b9f6&e=65d2b2b7c0) Shifting the focus from carbon to methane may buy critical time in climate change mitigation. Since 2015, Wofsy and collaborators have been working on MethaneSAT with the hopes of reducing methane emissions and allowing renewable energy sources to grow.\nSign-up for cutting-edge science delivered monthly to your inbox (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=318af7d2ea)\nhttps://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=8b3e492916&e=65d2b2b7c0 Share (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=4de35dc5f5&e=65d2b2b7c0)\nhttps://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=d81026bde3&e=65d2b2b7c0 http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2Fipr7mE Tweet (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=f1c994b09b&e=65d2b2b7c0 http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2Fipr7mE)\nhttps://us1.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=08f8e90b5b&e=65d2b2b7c0 Forward (https://us1.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=08f8e90b5b&e=65d2b2b7c0)\nunsubscribe (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=318af7d2ea&e=65d2b2b7c0&c=08f8e90b5b)  | update preferences (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/profile?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=318af7d2ea&e=65d2b2b7c0&c=08f8e90b5b)\nHarvard John A.

Swing by the John\nHarvard Statue on your way to class between 8:30 and 10 AM on April 20th\n(4/20 munchies??) to grab a delicious pancake and send a quick email\n<https://tinyurl.com/hotbrekky> to the administration demanding Hot\nBreakfast in the Houses!\n\nNo student should have to travel long distances or go out of their way just\nto get a fulfilling and nutritious meal in the morning, and most of us\ndon’t have the time. We shouldn’t have to skip breakfast or make do with\njust pastries and yogurt.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, HUDS workers are overwhelmed in Quincy\nHouse and Annenberg by the hundreds of students who swarm the halls for\nfood throughout the morning, and expanded breakfast in the Houses would\nprovide more hours for workers trying to support their families on jobs\nthat aren’t guaranteed to be 40 hours a week. Harvard has the money to\nprovide breakfast in more houses, and for the health and wellbeing of its\nstudents and workers, it must.\n\nIt takes just 60 seconds to send the email template below, but it lets our\nadministrators know that students across Harvard really do care about\nexpanding hot breakfast across Houses, and it shows HUDS workers that\nsomeone is listening. We and unionized HUDS workers really appreciate your\nsupport.\n\nPLEASE SEND THE AUTO-FILLED EMAIL <https://tinyurl.com/hotbrekky> (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/hotbrekky) NOW!\n\nWe’ll see you on 4/20 for pancakes in the Yard!\n\nXoxo,\n\nThe Hot Breakfast Campaign\n\n_______________________________________________\nFYRE mailing

Many of the group members have\n> participated in and learned the musical format through the Arabic Music\n> Retreat that is held yearly at Mount Holyoke College under the direction of\n> Simon Shaheen and AJ Racy, as well as students and faculty from the Berklee\n> School of Music in Boston.\n>\n> More recently, the group has evolved into its current members from the\n> Boston community and performs classical and folkloric Arabic musical\n> repertoire. The Boston Arabic Music Ensemble was under the artistic\n> direction of the late maestro Bassam Saba (from 2010 to 2018).

This question lingers\nover the contemporary politics of many countries where persistent\nimmigration has altered populations and may soon produce a majority\nminority milestone, where the original ethnic or religious majority loses\nits numerical advantage to one or more foreign-origin minority groups.\nUntil now, most of our knowledge about large-scale responses to demographic\nchange has been based on studies of individual people’s reactions, which\ntend to be instinctively defensive and intolerant. We know little about why\nand how these habits are sometimes tempered to promote more sustainable\ncoexistence. In *Majority Minority*, Justin Gest wields polling research,\nhistorical analysis, and interview-based fieldwork inside six of the\nworld’s few societies that have already experienced a majority minority\ntransition to understand what factors produce different social outcomes.\nGrounded in rich narratives and surprising survey findings, *Majority\nMinority* reveals that this contentious milestone and its accompanying\nidentity politics are ultimately subject to unifying or divisive governance.\n\n*Justin Gest <http://justingest.com/>* is an Associate Professor of Policy\nand Government at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and\nGovernment. He is the author of six books, primarily on the politics of\nimmigration and demographic change—all from Oxford University Press or\nCambridge University Press. He has also provided commentary, analysis, or\nreporting to a number of broadcast networks, including ABC, BBC, CBC, CNN,\nand NPR, and news publications including *The Boston Globe*, *The Guardian*\n, *Los Angeles Times*, *The New York Times*, POLITICO, Reuters, *The Times*,\nand *The Washington Post*. From 2010 to 2014, Professor Gest was a\npostdoctoral fellow and lecturer in Harvard University’s Departments of\nGovernment and Sociology. From 2007 to 2010, he co-founded and served as\nthe co-director of the Migration Studies Unit at the London School of\nEconomics and Political Science (LSE).\n\n[image: MM - Cover.jpeg]\n\n_______________________________________________\nCheck the Adams FAQ for answers to many common questions: http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions\n***List emails may not be reproduced, retransmitted, or otherwise republished without the express written consent of the author.\n\nadams-schmooze mailing list\nadams-schmooze@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/adams-schmooze\n"}],"2030632640":[{"date":"2023-04-27T21:50:48.000Z","subject":"[hcs-d] [HCS AI x HUMIC] Apply for Harvard AI Vision Fellowship (Summer 2023)","text":"The Harvard AI Vision Fellowship will run this summer with the goal of\nenabling Harvard students to explore and apply themselves to topics\nrelevant to AI, with greater resources and a strong support network.\n\nVision Fellows will have the opportunity to:\n\n   -\n\n   Work on independent projects of their interest, from technical\n   applications to econ/policy research\n   -\n\n   Learn about various fields and interdisciplinary approaches in AI (e.g.,\n   econ, law, engineering, ethics)\n   -\n\n   Discuss recent developments in AI with invited speakers and leaders in\n   industry and academia\n   -\n\n   Connect with other students working at the cutting edge (weekly/biweekly\n   remote fellows group)\n\n\nThe fellowship expects a commitment of 5-10 hours per week on\nprojects/development.

morning. A.I. does not have to be perfect or have human-level intelligence\nto be useful.\n\n\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/21/multimedia/21themorning-lede-tpkb/21themorning-lede-tpkb-jumbo.jpg]OpenAI\noffices in San Francisco.Jim Wilson/The New York Times\n\n\nSAVING TIME\n\nFor most people, ChatGPT is more of a toy than a tool. You can ask it silly\nquestions, but it’s not robust enough to write high-quality work memos or school\nessays. Yet the people behind artificial intelligence programs believe these\nsystems will someday become a regular part of our lives, helping us in\nday-to-day routines.\n\nHow? Some type of A.I. will usher in that reality not because it will be perfect\nor display human-level intelligence. It will simply perform a task better than\npeople can now. We don’t yet know what that task or the piece of A.I. will be.\nPerhaps it will be a task that seems small but nonetheless takes up time, like\nwriting an email response or organizing a schedule. Or it could be bigger, such\nas driving a car. Either way, the shift will be enough to get the public to\nwidely adopt it.\n\nPhone cameras are a useful analogy. They typically take lower quality\nphotographs than stand-alone cameras. But most people have embraced them because\nthey are so convenient, packaged in devices most of us carry everywhere. That\nsort of usefulness is a much lower bar for A.I. to meet than creating the kind\nof all-knowing, all-doing A.I. depicted in science fiction.\n\nThen, widespread adoption could help A.I. rapidly improve further. The\ntechnology is built on data. And the more people use A.I., the more data\ndevelopers can collect to adapt their programs. Today’s newsletter will look at\nhow that future could start.\n\n\nBETTER, NOT PERFECT\n\nThere is a pithy way to describe how technology progresses: It has to be better,\nnot perfect.\n\nOne example is A.I. that can code. People who don’t know how to code already use\nbots to produce full-fledged games, as my colleagues Francesca Paris and Larry\nBuchanan explained\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/3nLKUmob7A8IVWDwbkOZ1A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmJOxnP0TaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMy8wNC8xNC91cHNob3QvdXAtYWktdXNlcy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjEmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTA3MTkmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMDk5MCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD5nZ0Jk664a_lIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~].\nAnd some professional programmers use A.I. to supplement their work.\n\nThe current technology is imperfect. It can make mistakes, and it struggles with\nmore complicated tasks or programs. But the same is true for human coders.\n“Humans are not perfect at many of the tasks they perform,” said Helen Toner, a\ndirector at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nBy this standard, coding bots do not have to be flawless to replace existing\nwork. They merely have to save time. A human coder could then use that extra\ntime to improve on the A.I.’s work, brainstorm other ideas for programs or do\nsomething else entirely.\n\n\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES\n\nA.I. outcomes won’t always be good. With phone cameras, people sacrifice photo\nquality for convenience. The trade-offs could be more consequential with\nartificial intelligence.\n\nConsider an A.I. that can write well. At first, the quality might fall short of\nwriting you can do yourself. Still, like a coding A.I., it could give you time\nthat you could use to sharpen the draft, focus on research or complete a\ndifferent task.\n\nBut this bot also might not care about some qualities that humans value. Perhaps\nit will spin out falsehoods that some writers won’t catch before publishing\nonline. Or bad actors could use A.I. to create and distribute well-written\ndisinformation more efficiently.\n\nIn other words, what an A.I. does can fail to align with its creators’ or users’\ngoals. “It’s a very general technology that’s going to be used for so many\nthings,” Katja Grace, an A.I. safety researcher, said. “So it’s much harder to\nanticipate all the ways that you might be training it to do something that could\nbe harmful.”\n\nHere’s a real-world example: Ted Rall, a political cartoonist, recently asked\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/NZDI0aygXkLY_BikfXpdkg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmJOxnP4QiAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzai5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2hhdGdwdC1saWJlbGVkLW1lLWNhbi1pLXN1ZS1kZWZhbWF0aW9uLWxhdy1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1jYXJ0b29uaXN0LWNvdXJ0LWxhd3llcnMtdGVjaG5vbG9neS0xNDA4NjAzND9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDIxJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNzE5Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA5OTAmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-Z2dCZOuuGv5SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\nChatGPT to describe his relationship with Scott Stantis, another cartoonist. It\nfalsely suggested Stantis had accused Rall of plagiarism in 2002 and that both\nof them had a public feud. None of this happened.\n\nBut current A.I. technologies frequently produce these kinds of tall tales —\nwhat experts call hallucinations — when asked about real people or events.\nExperts aren’t sure why. One potential explanation is that these systems are\nprimarily programmed to put out convincing, conversational writing, not to\ndistinguish fact from fiction. As similar A.I. replaces human tasks or current\ntechnologies (such as search engines), the falsehoods could mislead many more\npeople.\n\n\nEXPONENTIAL GROWTH\n\nA.I. is developing incredibly quickly. The computing power behind the technology\nhas grown exponentially for decades, and experts expect it to continue doing so.\nAs impressive as GPT-4 is\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/D-DRHNH8H9dxmAE0PUCeNA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmJOxnP0TbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8xNC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L29wZW5haS1ncHQ0LWNoYXRncHQuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDIxJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNzE5Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA5OTAmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-Z2dCZOuuGv5SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~],\nwe could plausibly get A.I. programs that are many times as powerful in the span\nof years.\n\nThis technology is developing so quickly that lawmakers and other regulators\nhave been unable to keep up. More than 1,000 tech leaders and researchers\nrecently called for a pause on A.I. development to establish safety standards.\nSo far, there is no sign those calls have been heeded.

Stokes Company, 1920). According to the table of contents, “Gift” was composed by Conkling when she was between the ages of seven and nine years old. In her preface to the collection, Amy Lowell (https://poets.org/poet/amy-lowell?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID) writes, after listing “Gift” among the book’s most successful poems, that “[s]he probably hardly thought at all, so natural was it, to say that three pinks ‘smell like more of them in a blue vase,’ but the expression fills the air with so strong a scent that no superlative could increase it. ‘Gift’ is a lovely poem, it has feeling, expression, originality, cadence. If a child can write such a poem at eight years old, what does it mean? That depends, I think, on how long the instructors of youth can be persuaded to keep ‘hands off.’ A period of imitation is, I fear, inevitable, but if consciousness is not induced by direct c\nriticism, if instruction in the art of writing is abjured, the imitative period will probably be got [sic] through without undue loss. I think there is too much native sense of beauty and proportion here to be entirely killed even by the drying and freezing process which goes by the name of education.”\nhttps://poets.org/poet/hilda-conkling?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nHilda Conkling (https://poets.org/poet/hilda-conkling?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID) was born in New York State in 1910. Her poetry, which she composed between the ages of four and fourteen, is collected in Poems by a Little Girl (Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1920), Shoes of the Wind (Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1922), and Silverhorn, the Hilda Conkling Book for Other Children (Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1924). Hilda’s mother, poet Grace Hazard Conkling (https://poets.org/poet/grace-hazard-conkling?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID) , transcribed all of Hilda’s poems, which Hilda ceased composing altogether in her adulthood. She died on June 26, 1986.\n\nhttps://poets.org/poet/hilda-conkling?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/poemsbylittlegir0000hild/page/n9/mode/2up?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nPoems by a Little Girl (https://archive.org/details/poemsbylittlegir0000hild/page/n9/mode/2up?mc_cid=4cbb5e9a7b&mc_eid=UNIQID)\n(Frederick A.

Yet, it’s not that the worries have gone away. Just like in my early days, I’ve learned to find ways to ease the burdens and uneasiness of living.

Young\n\n\nIn Wimberley, Texas, there is a hole in the sandstone someone has called definitely deep blue. Bluebon-\n\n nets grow on the road up to it and lost mountain bluebirds fly around and in it in concentric circles.\n\n Tourists drop things in the freshwater and leave with new things that are harder to name like how do\n\n you name your own blue? As a child I tried not to lie. I had little to say about the screaming cow-bird\n\n and I didn&rsquo;t care about what it might like to eat. Mice, I might have guessed. Snakes. Or small-\n\n er birds, like blue jays. But it seemed often just as true that ravens might subsist solely on the wind from\n\n plumper birds, on their even more indigo hearts, that they might devour nightly the full blue apexes of\n\n constellations, tear Saturn apart at her ripe cerulean center. I dreamed of it. My name, Little Blue\n\n Heron.

Dominion claims that Fox spread a false conspiracy\ntheory that its machines were rigged against Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nThe trial had been set to start today, but the judge overseeing the case\nannounced a one-day delay last night. Fox may be seeking to settle the case\nbefore a trial can begin, The Wall Street Journal reported\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/ixqyw7NRComeTLQ7lyQgog~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmH6hzP0T_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mb3gtbmV3cy1kb21pbmlvbi1wcmVwYXJlLWZvci1iYXR0bGUtaW4tMS02LWJpbGxpb24tZGVmYW1hdGlvbi10cmlhbC1mYWQyZTlhNj9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwMzgwJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA2MjgmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQhcyM9ZN7rH2pSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~].\n\nWe have already seen some of the evidence for Dominion’s side. Texts and emails\nuncovered through the lawsuit show that several of Fox’s executives, hosts and\nproducers privately doubted the claims against Dominion, which were promoted by\nTrump, but amplified them on the air anyway.\n\nEven with this evidence, Dominion may not have an easy time winning the case\nbecause of legal protections for media companies. Those protections were\nestablished by a 1964 Supreme Court ruling, New York Times v. Sullivan, based on\nthe First Amendment’s safeguards for freedom of speech and the press. The ruling\nrequires that defamation lawsuits by public figures against media companies\nprove “actual malice,” meaning that journalists must have known an allegation\nwas false but broadcast it anyway or have acted so recklessly that they\noverlooked the facts.\n\n“It is an incredibly high bar to prove,” said my colleague Katie Robertson, who\nis covering the lawsuit.\n\nThe case will test whether Fox’s brand of journalism — which includes a long\nrecord of spreading falsehoods\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/PTexZmPPFw82mbr9teN2Hw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmH6hzP0TYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8wNi9tYWdhemluZS9mb3gtZG9taW5pb24tamFuLTYuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwMzgwJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA2MjgmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQhcyM9ZN7rH2pSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\n(such as about where Barack Obama was born) — is legally vulnerable.

Its task will be\nproving actual malice, as well as proving financial damage because of the\ncoverage.\n\nTo do that, Dominion will point to a trove of texts, emails and other documents\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/3TBa8bKHr2l65n4tIXmOWQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmH6hzP0T4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMy8wMi8yNS9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS9mb3gtbmV3cy1kb21pbmlvbi10dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MTcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTAzODAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMDYyOCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZCFzIz1k3usfalIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nshowing that Fox News’s leaders and hosts doubted the claims against Dominion\nbut aired them anyway.\n\nReferring to claims that Dominion’s software rigged the election, Tucker Carlson\ntexted his producer, Alex Pfeiffer, that the idea was “absurd.” He also texted\nthat Sidney Powell, one of Trump’s lawyers, was “lying.” Yet Carlson later\nargued on his show, “This is a real issue no matter who raises it or who tries\nto dismiss it out of hand as a conspiracy theory.”\n\nWhy did Carlson do this? It seems the answer has to do with his audience.\nCarlson initially cast doubt on Powell’s claims on air, saying, “She never\ndemonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from\none candidate to another. Not one.” His audience revolted\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/Xt9X-RldbYPtJ2B4Y6NYAA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmH6hzP0TdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS8yMC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9UdWNrZXItQ2FybHNvbi10cnVtcC5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MTcmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTAzODAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMDYyOCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZCFzIz1k3usfalIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~],\ncriticizing him for questioning a Trump ally. Carlson then walked back his\npublic skepticism on air.\n\nIt’s a recurring theme in the texts and emails. Fox’s leaders and hosts\nexpressed doubt about the conspiracy theory in private, but they also raised\nconcerns about “respecting our audience.” To avoid losing viewers to competitors\nlike Newsmax, Fox hosts and producers seemingly chose to broadcast and support\nthe claims by Trump and his allies.\n\n\nWHAT IS FOX NEWS’S ARGUMENT?\n\nFox News previously argued that even though it knew the claims against Dominion\nwere false, it had to cover them anyway because they were newsworthy. But Judge\nDavis has ruled that Fox won’t be able to make that argument in the trial. “Just\nbecause someone is newsworthy,” he said, referring to Trump and his lawyers,\n“doesn’t mean you can defame someone.”\n\nWithout that argument, Fox has focused on others. The network argues that\nDominion still needs to prove that Fox’s hosts — who ultimately decide what to\nair — knew the claims were false and broadcast them anyway. And Fox claims that\nat least some of the hosts genuinely believed the allegations and therefore were\nnot intentionally defaming anyone.\n\nMostly, though, Fox is relying on Dominion failing to clear the high legal\nstandard established by New York Times v. Sullivan. Dominion, not Fox, has the\nburden of proof.\n\nLegal experts have said that Dominion’s case is stronger than most defamation\nlawsuits but that the company still may not win. “Proving this in a legal sense\nis more complicated than proving it in the court of public opinion,” said my\ncolleague Jim Rutenberg, who wrote a Times Magazine article about the case\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/PTexZmPPFw82mbr9teN2Hw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmH6hzP0TYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8wNi9tYWdhemluZS9mb3gtZG9taW5pb24tamFuLTYuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE3Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwMzgwJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA2MjgmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQhcyM9ZN7rH2pSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~].\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?\n\nFox News argues that if it loses, the case will do irreparable damage to press\nfreedoms, opening all news outlets to lawsuits. “A free-flowing, robust American\ndiscourse depends on First Amendment protections for the press’ news gathering\nand reporting,” a network spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nSome legal experts argue the opposite, saying that a loss for Fox could bolster\nprotections for the press.

The application will remain open after that date but instructors have access after Wednesday.\nSarah\n\nFrom: Colgan, Sarah <scolgan@seas.harvard.edu>\nSent: Wednesday, April 5, 2023 1:00 PM\nTo: seas-undergrads@seas.harvard.edu\nSubject: [cs-undergrads] CA application for select SEAS courses-apply by 4/19 for full consideration\n\nDear SEAS undergraduate students,\n\nAre you interested in working on the teaching staff for a SEAS course this fall?\n\nSEAS is hiring Course Assistants (CAs, often referred to in SEAS as TFs) for Fall 2023. Typical responsibilities for this position include, but are not limited to, leading discussion or laboratory sections, holding office hours, answering student questions on course content, grading assignments, maintaining the course website, and attending course meetings. Applicants who have a strong interest in or understanding of the course material (for example, who took the course and received an A- or an A) are encouraged to apply.\n\nTo apply to select SEAS courses in AM, AP, Eng Sci and ESE, please complete this form: https://forms.gle/HVspeZKpPcn1KU3aA<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__forms.gle_HVspeZKpPcn1KU3aA&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=oUO5mwpQ-aFXjiroqfBYXBwsDriw25PVAWN3XaQ0GU4&m=BnLxU4GsdN8C5mb7ajN0fHsiGc66BRCyxZV0kp5leNWxcHdNDWDmZqhcQVGar6p7&s=W9odL6NxVzXtbBUeStMYY0DAFpPYOksfGiblTG_K9Zg&e=>\nPlease note that not all courses that have open positions are included in the application, and CS courses have a separate application process (see email from Adam Hesterberg).\n\nThe application form requires a reference name, a CV, an unofficial transcript, and any previous CA evaluations. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with full consideration guaranteed for applications submitted by April 19. Some courses may guarantee full consideration for applications submitted later.\nThere are various teaching fellow roles available, depending on the course. Start and end dates are to be determined, but these are fall term appointments. These positions are supervised by the instructor of record and all positions are in-person in Fall 2023 in Cambridge or Allston. The pay rate is $23/hour and pay is distributed weekly. A standard CA position is for 10 hours/week averaged over the appointment period.\n\nHarvard students who fill these roles would be eligible for membership in the Harvard Graduate Student Union (HGSU-UAW). SEAS is dedicated to building a diverse community of individuals who are committed to contributing to an inclusive environment. Some of our core values include respect for all, serving the greater good, and welcoming individuals from diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer, and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions, or any other characteristic protected by law.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSarah\n---\nSarah Colgan\nAcademic Programs Administrator | she/her/hers\nOffice of Academic Programs | P: 617-496-1524\nHarvard John A.

More Americans could see a boost in their credit scores after credit agencies scrapped 70% of all medical debt in collections. Last year, <strong>Experian</strong>, <strong>TransUnion</strong>, and <strong>Equifax</strong> removed already paid medical debt from millions of credit reports. Last week they took it a step further by removing all <em>unpaid</em> debt up to $500. Nearly a tenth of US adults owe at least $250 in medical debt, but many don’t notice until it dings their credit score.

Majority Minority","text":"Hi Schmooze,\n\nThis Thursday at 8pm in the LCR we will be hosting SCR member Justin Gest\nas he talks about his new book, *Majority Minority*.\n\nMore info below and see you there!\n\nSanti\n\n\n*Majority Minority: How will America respond to demographic change?*\n\nHow do societies respond to great demographic change? This question lingers\nover the contemporary politics of many countries where persistent\nimmigration has altered populations and may soon produce a majority\nminority milestone, where the original ethnic or religious majority loses\nits numerical advantage to one or more foreign-origin minority groups.\nUntil now, most of our knowledge about large-scale responses to demographic\nchange has been based on studies of individual people’s reactions, which\ntend to be instinctively defensive and intolerant. We know little about why\nand how these habits are sometimes tempered to promote more sustainable\ncoexistence. In *Majority Minority*, Justin Gest wields polling research,\nhistorical analysis, and interview-based fieldwork inside six of the\nworld’s few societies that have already experienced a majority minority\ntransition to understand what factors produce different social outcomes.\nGrounded in rich narratives and surprising survey findings, *Majority\nMinority* reveals that this contentious milestone and its accompanying\nidentity politics are ultimately subject to unifying or divisive governance.\n\n*Justin Gest <http://justingest.com/>* is an Associate Professor of Policy\nand Government at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and\nGovernment. He is the author of six books, primarily on the politics of\nimmigration and demographic change—all from Oxford University Press or\nCambridge University Press.

Her current research activities\ninclude a study of how Boston Public School early childhood classrooms are\nsupporting children's development, and participation in a long-standing\nresearch-practice partnership (the Strategic Education Research\nPartnership, SERP) that is developing curricular tools to support teachers\nin introducing innovative classroom practices. Word Generation, a\ndiscussion-based academic language and literacy program developed by SERP,\nhas been shown to improve middle-school literacy outcomes, in particular\nfor students from language-minority homes.\"\n\n*Dr. Gina Kuperberg:* \"Gina R Kuperberg, MD PhD, is the Dennett Stibel\nProfessor of Cognitive Science at Tufts University. She is also a Board\nCertified Psychiatrist and Principal Investigator in the Psychiatry\nNeuroscience Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Her research\nprogram uses multimodal neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG and EEG evoked\nresponses, oscillatory activity, and Representational Similarity Analysis),\nneuropsychological testing and computational modeling to understand when,\nwhere and how the human brain builds meaning from language, and how these\nmechanisms break down in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.\"\n\n*Dr. Jesse Snedeker: *\"Research in my lab explores how children learn\nlanguage, how language encodes meaning (semantics), how people understand\nspeech as they are hearing it, and how these processes are affected by\ndevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism) or differences in the context in\nwhich a language is acquired (e.g., international adoption).\"\n\n*Dr. Asifa Majid:* \"Asifa Majid is a professor of cognitive science at the\nUniversity of Oxford. Majid studies the relationship among language,\nculture, and mind. Humans are one species, and yet we speak 7,000\ndifferent, mutually unintelligible languages, each hosted in distinct\ncultural niches around the globe. How does this diversity of language,\nculture, and experience affect how people think and behave? During her\nfellowship year, Majid is writing a book to synthesize her wide-ranging\nempirical work to elucidate which aspects of cognition are fundamentally\nshared and which are language- or culture-specific.\"\n\n*Dr. Gennaro Chierchia:* \"I have been spending my intellectual life\nstudying how meaning takes shape in human language. A common thread in my\nwork is the idea/claim/speculation that a logic (a way of drawing\ninferences) spontaneously grows and latches on to the syntactic structures\nproduced by our capacity for recursive computation. This ‘natural logic’\ngives a special power to our ability to use language to communicate and\nrefer, a power not found in other species. Some more specific recurring\nthemes/obsessions are properties and predication (control/raising/*de\nse* attributions),\nNoun Phrase structure (quantified vs. ‘bare’ nominals, mass vs. count),\nanaphora and presuppositions, implicatures and polarity phenomena. I am\nalso very interested in pursuing these topics by experimental means.\"\n\n\n-- \n*Carly Tiras*\nA.B.

We and unionized HUDS workers really appreciate your\nsupport.\n\nPLEASE SEND THE AUTO-FILLED EMAIL <https://tinyurl.com/hotbrekky> (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/hotbrekky) NOW!\n\nWe’ll see you on 4/20 for pancakes in the Yard!\n\nXoxo,\n\nThe Hot Breakfast Campaign\n\n_______________________________________________\nCheck the Adams FAQ for answers to many common questions: http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions\n***List emails may not be reproduced, retransmitted, or otherwise republished without the express written consent of the author.\n\nadams-schmooze mailing list\nadams-schmooze@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/adams-schmooze\n"}],"-1215635011":[{"date":"2023-04-18T13:53:05.000Z","subject":"FREE: Moon Pillow ($125) for Mothers’ Day ❤","text":"Every mom deserves a massage for mothers' day! \n ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌\n\n\nhttps://pranamat.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZwcmFuYW1hdGVjby5jb20lMkYlM0Z1dG1fc291cmNlJTNEYWN0aXZlY2FtcGFpZ24lMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtJTNEZW1haWwlMjZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ24lM0RoZWFkZXItY2xpY2tzJTI2dXRtX3Rlcm0lM0Rsb2dv&sig=9fzK5KLTtictEpA3mBacv6XySjNCKhqQax9wJ7tECM3c&iat=1681826533&a=%7C%7C649918555%7C%7C&account=pranamat%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ZY1b85bk35qZny2%2FLOXEjfPuO4WwSWCwiKKeWjMn0KKHPTPG%2FOqXLGfz2cY6tBc%3D%3AKCErGa1WuKiy9zGvoig%2BwqCC%2FlVIkfAW&s=0d3e7f55ab7d0d7da0e932781ac29452&i=1088A1497A10A13385\n\n\nHOW IT HELPS\n<https://pranamat.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZwcmFuYW1hdC5jb20lMkZob3dpdGhlbHBzJTNGdXRtX3NvdXJjZSUzRGFjdGl2ZWNhbXBhaWduJTI2dXRtX21lZGl1bSUzRGVtYWlsJTI2dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduJTNEaGVhZGVyLWNsaWNrcyUyNnV0bV90ZXJtJTNEaG93LWl0LWhlbHBz&sig=6GKeQFZttEWPPADhSbeTqXAzH4VArdudbWuxNHboHrpS&iat=1681826533&a=%7C%7C649918555%7C%7C&account=pranamat%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ZY1b85bk35qZny2%2FLOXEjfPuO4WwSWCwiKKeWjMn0KKHPTPG%2FOqXLGfz2cY6tBc%3D%3AKCErGa1WuKiy9zGvoig%2BwqCC%2FlVIkfAW&s=0d3e7f55ab7d0d7da0e932781ac29452&i=1088A1497A10A13386>\n\nHOW TO USE\n<https://pranamat.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZwcmFuYW1hdC5jb20lMkZ0ZXh0JTJGaG93dG91c2UlM0Z1dG1fc291cmNlJTNEYWN0aXZlY2FtcGFpZ24lMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtJTNEZW1haWwlMjZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ24lM0RoZWFkZXItY2xpY2tzJTI2dXRtX3Rlcm0lM0Rob3ctdG8tdXNl&sig=EEpAz86ypw3BQAp7Yqs3zFtCrCAjtM1MLx5GvxfymMUG&iat=1681826533&a=%7C%7C649918555%7C%7C&account=pranamat%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ZY1b85bk35qZny2%2FLOXEjfPuO4WwSWCwiKKeWjMn0KKHPTPG%2FOqXLGfz2cY6tBc%3D%3AKCErGa1WuKiy9zGvoig%2BwqCC%2FlVIkfAW&s=0d3e7f55ab7d0d7da0e932781ac29452&i=1088A1497A10A13387>\n\nREVIEWS\n<https://pranamat.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZwcmFuYW1hdC5jb20lMkZyZXZpZXdzJTNGdXRtX3NvdXJjZSUzRGFjdGl2ZWNhbXBhaWduJTI2dXRtX21lZGl1bSUzRGVtYWlsJTI2dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduJTNEaGVhZGVyLWNsaWNrcyUyNnV0bV90ZXJtJTNEcmV2aWV3cw==&sig=8f9c8ckZLc1dZF7bTQxN82TKruieRx4WY8DZvDNh4yYH&iat=1681826533&a=%7C%7C649918555%7C%7C&account=pranamat%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ZY1b85bk35qZny2%2FLOXEjfPuO4WwSWCwiKKeWjMn0KKHPTPG%2FOqXLGfz2cY6tBc%3D%3AKCErGa1WuKiy9zGvoig%2BwqCC%2FlVIkfAW&s=0d3e7f55ab7d0d7da0e932781ac29452&i=1088A1497A10A13388>\n\n****Are you looking for a unique and meaningful Mother's Day gift?****\n\n...that will make your mom feel appreciated and pampered?

Since then, the two countries have followed very\ndifferent paths:\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/18/briefing/oakImage-1681845821564/oakImage-1681845821564-jumbo.png]Source:\nWorld Bank | Data is in current U.S. dollars. | By The New York Times\n\nWhat happened after the late 1970s? Under Deng Xiaoping, its ruler at the time,\nChina began to open its economy to market forces and foreign investment. It\nmoved away from the inefficiencies of state-run communism.\n\nBut the government did so in a measured way, rather than fully embracing\nlaissez-faire capitalism. China maintained trade protections that helped its\ncompanies grow: In exchange for allowing foreign companies to build factories,\nChina restricted those companies’ ability to sell goods in China and required\nthem to share technology with local companies. This mix of market capitalism and\ngovernment regulation was the same one that other countries — including the\nUnited States, long ago — have used to industrialize.\n\nThe strategy worked phenomenally well. Hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens\nmoved from poor, rural areas to take factory jobs in cities. The resulting\ndecline in poverty may be the largest in human history.\n\nIndia was never a communist country, but it did have a weak socialist-style\neconomy in the 1970s suffering the aftereffects of British colonialism. And\nIndia was slower to modernize than China, as my colleagues Mujib Mashal and Alex\nTravelli — both based in Delhi — point out in a new story about the population\nmilestone\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/xhiVwg0afJrJlVJpWw_9Qw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIkxcP0TeaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xOS93b3JsZC9hc2lhL2luZGlhLWNoaW5hLXBvcHVsYXRpb24uaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNTQ3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA4MDImdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ_XMc_ZAQFFJFSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~].\n\n“India started opening its quasi-socialist economy nearly a decade later,” Mujib\nand Alex write. “Its approach remained piecemeal, constrained by tricky\ncoalition politics and the competing interests of industrialists, unions,\nfarmers and factions across its social spectrum.”\n\nIndia’s lag allowed China to grab a first-mover advantage. By the 1990s, China’s\nmanufacturing sector was developed enough to be much more efficient than\nIndia’s. Even though wages were somewhat lower in India, many foreign companies\nchose to locate in China.\n\nOne factor was the Chinese government’s aggressive investments in roads,\nairports, rail networks and other infrastructure. Today, transit in China is\noften more advanced than in the United States\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/kVx93rE1HUioD74YXc2M6g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIkxcP0TfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xNC9vcGluaW9uL2NoaW5hLWFtZXJpY2EtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MDU0NyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMwODAyJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkP1zHP2QEBRSRUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA].\nTransportation in India tends to be less convenient.\n\nIndia’s recent leaders, including Narendra Modi, the current prime minister,\nhave absorbed this lesson and tried to catch up, spending large sums on\ninfrastructure. They have made significant progress even though China remains\nfar ahead, Mujib and Alex explain. “India’s time has arrived,” Modi recently\nsaid.\n\n(Related: Apple opened its first retail store in India\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/IGzMQn1Azzcql4dMyS84sg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmIkxcP0ThaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy9hcHBsZS1zdG9yZXMtaW5kaWEtdGltLWNvb2suaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNTQ3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA4MDImdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ_XMc_ZAQFFJFSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\nyesterday.)\n\n\nINDIA’S GENDER GAP\n\nA second factor is education.

Only about\none-fifth of Indian women work in a formal job. “In terms of education,\nemployment, digital access and various other parameters, girls and women do not\nhave equal access to life-empowering tools and means as the boys and men have,”\nPoonam Muttreja, the executive director of the Population Foundation of India, a\nresearch group, told The Times. “This needs to change for India to truly reap\nthe demographic dividend.”\n\nThe “demographic dividend” is a reference to recent population trends in India:\nThe country’s largest age group is people in the prime of their working lives.\nChina’s population is aging rapidly, because of its longtime one-child policy,\nand declined last year for the first time since the 1960s (when Mao’s policies\ncaused a famine). The World Bank projects China’s working-age population to fall\nto 600 million by 2050 and India’s to rise to 800 million.\n\nThe demographic dividend gives India a chance to expand both its economy and its\nglobal influence.

I began to think of this sort of ritual in relationship to other rituals around fear, cleanliness, disease, and the pandemic. The pandemic caused many of us to retreat behind our screens and seek validation there, distancing us from others as well as ourselves. This poem asks us to come back to ourselves, to our finitude, to our hungers.”\n—Roger Reeves\nhttp://poets.org/poet/roger-reeves?mc_cid=90edc931c8&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nRoger Reeves (http://poets.org/poet/roger-reeves?mc_cid=90edc931c8&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of Dark Days: Fugitive Essays (Graywolf Press, 2023), Best Barbarian (W.

However, the majority of research on spatial factors and health has relied on residential addresses to assign exposure, questionnaire data to measure health behaviors and health outcomes, and coarse and nonspecific indices to estimate exposure to spatial factors. Recent technological advances have provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Mobile health technologies—including GPS-enabled smartphones and consumer wearables like Fitbits—have opened new doorways to track personalized exposure and granular data on mental health, cognitive function, and health behaviors from minute to minute. Deep learning algorithms applied to Google Street View images empower us to estimate exposure to specific features of the built and natural environment from an on the ground perspective to quantify their impact on health. In this talk, I will speak about my experience integrating mobile health technologies, consumer wearables, and Google Street View imagery into several prospective cohorts, including the Nurses' Health Studies and Project Viva.\n\nBio:  Peter James is an Associate Professor in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC) Institute, and an Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His research focuses on estimating the influence of spatial factors, including exposure to nature, the built environment, the food environment, air pollution, light pollution, noise, and socioeconomic status, on health behaviors and chronic disease. More recently, he is developing methodologies to assess real-time, high spatio-temporal resolution objective measures of location and behavior by linking smartphone-based global positioning systems (GPS) and consumer wearable device accelerometry data to understand how spatial factors influence health behaviors. Dr. James earned his ScD from the Department of Environmental Health and the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He holds a MHS in Environmental Health Sciences from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups

If you would like to respond to the tutor, please REPLY ALL to this email. Thanks.\n\n  Student: Ishika Bhagavathula\n  Tutor: Eelaaf Zahid\n  Subject(s): Algebra\n  Date: 04/19/2023\n  Location: Online\n  Time Tutored: 17:00 - 18:00\n  Next Scheduled Session: Tue, 04/25  5:00 PM (https://harvard.zoom.us/j/95887604540?pwd=TUlKQjQ0empvNzFRK01rT053Q1hxQT09)\n\n  Material Covered:\n  We first reviewed the homework. Ishika had been asked to correct the two problems she had wrong last time. She did so correctly and was able to inform me that she just made some incorrect math calculations, which led to the errors. We then worked on solving systems of linear equations with substitution. Ishika really struggled with setting up the equations for word problems. We discussed defining the variables, then defining as many equations as variables, and finally solving with substitution. Ishika did better with the third problem, but I do encourage her to practice by working through the homework problems. \n\n  Additional Comments:\n  Dear Mrs. Sangeeta,\n\nI had a wonderful session with Ishika yesterday.

That plan is now in\ndoubt because Democrats do not have the votes to confirm judges without\nFeinstein.\n\nInstead, about 20 Biden nominees are in limbo, and 9 percent of District Court\nand Circuit Court judgeships remain vacant. Among Biden’s unconfirmed nominees:\nMónica Ramírez Almadani, a civil rights lawyer; Robert Kirsch, a former\nprosecutor who focused on white collar crime; and Kato Crews, an expert in labor\nlaw.\n\n\nTRUMP’S RECORD\n\nUntil recently, Republicans often put more emphasis on appointing judges than\nDemocrats did. That focus has contributed to conservative policy victories, with\nfederal courts stymying liberal policies on climate change, immigration and\nworkers’ rights.\n\nThe past few weeks have brought another such issue — abortion.\nRepublican-appointed judges have issued rulings that would restrict the\ndistribution of pills used to end pregnancies, an increasingly important part of\nabortion practice. The Supreme Court has paused the effect of those rulings\nthrough Friday while it considers the case\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ntppyZeIh-KqjxITVU3mZw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmI5m-P0TkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xOS91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9hYm9ydGlvbi1waWxsLXN1cHJlbWUtY291cnQuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDIwJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkwNjI1Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzA4ODAmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-vhRBZKQFEr5SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~].\n\nDonald Trump, with help from Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans, was\nespecially aggressive\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/pOChJ-MjhQse-WNX7jfhIw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmI5m-P0TaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy8xNC91cy90cnVtcC1hcHBlYWxzLWNvdXJ0LWp1ZGdlcy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjAmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTA2MjUmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMDg4MCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD6-FEFkpAUSvlIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nabout appointing judges.

Some progressive activists argue that Democratic leaders should try to\nchange Senate rules so that the filibuster could not block a change to the\nJudiciary Committee membership, but Democrats may not have the votes to pass\nthat change, my colleague Annie Karni, who covers Congress, says.\n\n“Democrats are stuck,” Annie told me, “and they just hope she comes back soon.”\n\nThe other solution for Democrats would be Feinstein’s resignation. In that case,\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, would replace her, and he has\npledged to name a Black woman to fill the seat. Either way, Feinstein has said\nshe will not run for re-election next year, and three high-profile California\npoliticians have announced their candidacies: Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie\nPorter and Adam Schiff.\n\n\n‘ABOUT THE NATION’\n\nSome Democrats have become increasingly bold about calling for Feinstein’s\nresignation or at least raising the subject:\n\n * “If this goes on month after month after month, then she’s going to have to\n   make a decision with her family and her friends about what her future holds,”\n   Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said this week. “This isn’t just\n   about California; it’s also about the nation.”\n * “She has been an icon on issues of gun violence and women’s rights, but it\n   has become painfully obvious to many of us in California that she is no\n   longer able to fulfill her duties as she doesn’t have a clear return date,”\n   Representative Ro Khanna, who represents Northern California, said last week\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/RAgJjntI--W5rRJUhLeWNA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmI5m-P0TfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzEyL3BvbGl0aWNzL2toYW5uYS1mZWluc3RlaW4tcmVzaWduL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyMCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MDYyNSZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMwODgwJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkPr4UQWSkBRK-Uh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA].\n * “Senator Feinstein is a remarkable American whose contributions to our\n   country are immeasurable,” Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota tweeted\n   last week. “But I believe it’s now a dereliction of duty to remain in the\n   Senate and a dereliction of duty for those who agree to remain quiet.”\n\nOther Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, say that\nFeinstein has earned the right to remain and have suggested that the criticism\nof her is sexist. “I’ve never seen them go after a man who was sick in the\nSenate in that way,” Pelosi said.\n\nFeinstein’s defenders are certainly correct that sexism plays a big role in\nAmerican politics. But the biggest distinguishing feature of the current\nsituation isn’t Feinstein’s sex. She is not the first female member of Congress\nto serve while old or ill. What makes this case different are the consequences.\n\nNo other aging member of Congress in decades, if not longer, has blocked one of\nhis or her political party’s biggest priorities.\n\nBut Democrats do not seem to have a solution to their problem.\n\nRelated: Some Democrats have also called for an end to the “blue slip” process,\nwhich has given Republicans a veto over any Biden nominee to a trial-court\njudgeship in their home state.

The\ngroup gathered in several venues from private homes to local universities\nsuch as MIT and Harvard, and lately at the Center for Arabic Culture to\ncelebrate that rich musical heritage. Many of the group members have\nparticipated in and learned the musical format through the Arabic Music\nRetreat that is held yearly at Mount Holyoke College under the direction of\nSimon Shaheen and AJ Racy, as well as students and faculty from the Berklee\nSchool of Music in Boston.\n\nMore recently, the group has evolved into its current members from the\nBoston community and performs classical and folkloric Arabic musical\nrepertoire. The Boston Arabic Music Ensemble was under the artistic\ndirection of the late maestro Bassam Saba (from 2010 to 2018). Since 2018,\nit has been led by the award-winning violinists, composers, and educators\nLayth Sidiq and Bengisu Gökçe.\n\nThe Boston Arabic Music Ensemble (BAME) welcomes committed intermediate and\nadvanced level musicians.

Charismatic\nmegafauna. All of them\n\nnow breed at higher latitude,\nwhich means the things\nthat bred at that higher latitude\nnow breed elsewhere\n\nand elsewhere\neat. I linger at the end,\nthe edge of it. I tread\nthe precipice\n\nof the abyss. It is Friday,\nearly, and my son\nis newly born. In the dark\nhe coos and grunts. The slowing\n\nstream of morning\nnews murmurs in his ear.\nIt cradles him\nin a sound, like some\n\nobject of history.\nOutside, berry brambles\nglisten in an almost\nabsent wind, here\n\nand there starting up\nto toss pollen from a node.\nThe starlings, always\nstarlings, tighten\n\nlike fists along a strand\nof telephone wire.\nMy son, he’s sucking\non my finger. He’s looking\n\nup at me with two bulbous\nslate gray eyes that hardly\nlet me scrawl these words.\nI think of the beluga\n\nwhale stitched on his shirt, the fishy\ntaste of the milk it feeds\nits own young, born in warmer\nwaters, which push them\n\ntoward the pole. Here, sun\npummels the windows\nand the exposed planks of the house,\nsummons tiny seedlings\n\nfrom the mud. It desiccates\nthe herbs left hanging\non the porch. My son\nwrithes in my arm, a single\n\nmuscle almost, slacking\nand contracting as he throws\nanother wail. The end, it’s moving\ntoward us. His future’s set\n\nin an unreadable script.\nThrough glass\nI watch starlings shuffle\nand drift, displace\n\ngrubworms from the dirt.\nMy neighbor shaves\na bristlecone pine toppled\nin the morning heat. He drops\n\nthe limbs in piles\nand soaks the wood in flame.\nSomewhere in the distance\nplankton colonies dissolve.\n\nWhales go with them.\nThe oak trees\nburn in Spain. My son\nrolls his eyes over curtains\n\nand patterned sheets, gazes\nat the azure\nlight of the TV. At his lips,\na milky bubble. He moves\n\nhis tiny head. He dozes\nto the changeless whir\nof the machine, gogging, I presume,\nat its slow and secret ministry.\nCopyright © 2023 by John James.

Established in 2019 with generous support from Treehouse Investments, the prize is given to honor exceptional poems that help make real for readers the gravity of the vulnerable state of our environment at present. Beginning with Earth Day, Poem-a-Day will feature this year’s three winners on consecutive weekends.\n\n“‘Lullaby’ skillfully captures the painful scale that is so characteristic of the climate emergency: the tension of trying to embrace the joys of an individual life, such as holding a newborn baby, while simultaneously being aware that this delight takes place against the large-scale backdrop of global catastrophe. This poem balances the dynamic of private versus public experience, local versus global, and internal versus external in a way that makes our current crisis feel both personal and intimate.”\n—Dr. Peter Kalmus and Matthew Olzmann\n\n“I composed ‘Lullaby’ in the early hours in the weeks after my son Wendell was born. Sitting on an exercise ball, I bounced him to sleep, holding him in my left arm while with my right I typed and revised the poem. I thought, then, about the mysteries his future holds, as well as certain certainties, not least of all the increasing reality of anthropogenic climate change and our society’s inability to address this growing catastrophe. The poem ends with an allusion (https://poets.org/glossary/allusion?mc_cid=8a6cc2e524&mc_eid=UNIQID) to [Samuel Taylor] Coleridge (https://poets.org/poet/samuel-taylor-coleridge?mc_cid=8a6cc2e524&mc_eid=UNIQID) ’s ‘Frost at Midnight (https://poets.org/poem/frost-midnight?mc_cid=8a6cc2e524&mc_eid=UNIQID) ,’ another poem written by a father for a son, against the weather.”\n—John James\nhttp://poets.org/poet/john-james?mc_cid=8a6cc2e524&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nJohn James (http://poets.org/poet/john-james?mc_cid=8a6cc2e524&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of The Milk Hours (Milkweed, 2019).

Monday, Apr 24, 2023 at 05:00pm\n\nRefreshments will be served.\n\n\nIndia launched the Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in 2018 to provide cashless healthcare coverage for hospitalization to the poorest 40 percent of the population. The scheme forms an important component of the country’s journey towards universal health coverage. In this presentation, the institutional structures associated with the organization of purchasing arrangements in the PMJAY will be examined, with a focus on comparing the performance of government trusts versus private insurance companies. The governance arrangements that underly this performance will be delineated to invite discussion around the potential future role of government and the market in purchasing care in the world’s largest government- funded insurance program.\n\n[cid:cdd56798-9c97-4154-b867-96b698e4e003]<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUFpKNzOqzLqBMz4-kmsBeastYZsY_nNR1PMqkdCqFbe1YDg/viewform>\n\n\nSpeaker: Kheya Melo Furtado, PhD\nMittal Institute Bajaj Fellow, Spring 2023\n\nKheya has been working as Faculty of the Healthcare Management programme at the Goa Institute of Management, India since 2018. Her areas of research, consultancy and teaching are Health Systems Financing and Public Health. She has secured research projects as Principal Investigator from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Harvard School of Public Health. Her current research focusses on policy and implementation assessments of India’s national publicly financed insurance scheme, the Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, as well as other state-level health protection schemes in India. She is interested in the issues of mixed health systems, particularly in the role of the private sector in achieving health system goals.\n\nPrior to GIM, she served at the Health Division of the NITI Aayog, the policy think-tank of the Government of India, New Delhi, where she implemented key projects such as the NITI Health Index for ranking States & UTs on their performance in Health; the drafting of the Health Chapter of the Three- Year Action Agenda for Government of India 2017-18 to 2019-20 and the NITI District hospital index for monitoring the performance of public hospitals. She also contributed policy inputs on key national health schemes and initiatives.\n\nHer doctoral research was carried out on the role of private sector engagement and participation in disease surveillance, under the INSPIRE Fellowship award of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.\n\nModerator: Winnie Yip\nProfessor of the Practice of Global Health Policy and Economics in the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nDr. Yip holds a PhD in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on rigorous and policy-relevant health system evaluations and the design and testing of innovative health system interventions to improve equitable access to efficient and good quality health care. In particular, she integrates economics, organization theory, management, and political economy to examine the use of national and state-level policy levers—including financing, provider payment, strategic purchasing, governance, and regulation—to leverage delivery system change. She currently applies this approach to developing viable and effective models of population health based integrated delivery systems in China and India. She is also interested in the implications of China’s ageing population for the country’s health system and in designing and piloting innovative eldercare systems to support older adults in living meaningful lives.\n\n\n"}],"-1224665588":[{"date":"2023-04-24T12:37:53.000Z","subject":"[hcs-d] [HCQCA] Happening TODAY!

He would regularly focus on the\nnotion of the “great replacement,” a racist conspiracy theory that claims elites\nare importing supposedly obedient immigrants to disempower native-born\nAmericans. In 2018, Carlson argued that hordes of immigrants were making America\n“poorer and dirtier.”\n\nCarlson often highlighted local news stories but twisted them to make broader\nclaims about Americans losing control of their country. In one segment in 2017,\nhe claimed “Gypsies” were causing chaos in a small Pennsylvania town, urinating\nand defecating in the streets.\n\n“The message of these segments was always the same: You and your way of life are\nunder attack, and the people doing the attacking look different and have\ndifferent values than you do,” my colleague Nicholas Confessore, who covered\nCarlson’s rise for The Times\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/GRZjk-kjG5wChgteE2WNLg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmKjVGP0TtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8zMC9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS90dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi1mb3gtbmV3cy10YWtlYXdheXMuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI1Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMDAzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzEyOTAmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-RrBHZPtcLzRSH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~],\ntold me yesterday. “Carlson reassured viewers that their discomfort was\nreasonable — that they didn’t have to feel bad about their fears and worries.”\n\nCarlson did so by embracing Trumpism but not Trump himself. The approach was\npartly personal. In private texts, Carlson said of Trump, “I hate him\npassionately.” It also helped Carlson differentiate himself from other Fox News\nhosts, Nicholas said. Because they aligned themselves closely with Trump, the\nhosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham would often have to come to his defense\nwhen Trump said something outrageous. Carlson tried to avoid those pitfalls by\nfocusing on the underlying message instead of Trump as the public face of it.\n\nFox’s predominantly white audience embraced Carlson’s approach, and he drew more\nthan three million viewers a night, regularly making his show No. 1 or No. 2 at\nthe network. And although accusations of bigotry and falsehoods prompted\nsponsors to flee Fox, Carlson’s show increased its ad revenue because its\naudience was so large.\n\nCarlson has not said what he’ll do next. But without that big audience, he\nprobably won’t be as influential.\n\n\nUNCERTAIN FUTURE\n\nFox News said it would rotate hosts in its 8 p.m. slot until it could find a\npermanent replacement. At first glance, this seems bad for the network: Not only\ndid it lose one of its biggest stars, but it has no replacement lined up. And\nthe announcement comes at a time when Fox has already faced months of bad\npublicity, and it just agreed to a $787.5 million settlement over Dominion’s\nlawsuit.\n\nBut Fox has overcome similar challenges with its hosts before. Carlson himself\nreplaced Bill O’Reilly, who was once the network’s most popular host, and not\nonly maintained O’Reilly’s ratings but at times surpassed them. That experience\nmay have led Fox to believe that the network carries more sway over its viewers\nthan individual hosts do.\n\nThe former Fox executive Roger Ailes used to occasionally bench his prime time\nstars for a night to show them that the ratings stayed high when they were gone\n— demonstrating that it was Fox that made them big, Nicholas noted. “I suspect\nthe audience loyalty to Fox is probably greater than the audience loyalty to any\nparticular Fox star,” he added.\n\n\nFOR MORE\n\n * A lack of premium advertisers in recent years had done little to hurt\n   Carlson’s standing\n

The talk will begin with\na brief overview of the QuAIL team and some general remarks on the status\nof and prospects for quantum computing. The talk will then transition to a\ndiscussion of distributed quantum computing, with an emphasis on recent\nresults in the quantum CONGEST-CLIQUE Model (qCCM). I’ll introduce both the\nclassical and quantum CONGEST-CLIQUE Models of distributed computation, and\nthen outline two quantum algorithms that succeed with high probability; one\nyields an approximately optimal Steiner Tree, and the other an exact\ndirected minimum spanning tree, each using asymptotically fewer rounds of\ncommunication than any known algorithms in the classical CONGEST-CLIQUE\nmodel. We achieve these results by combining classical algorithms with fast\nquantum subroutines. Additionally, we characterize the constants and\nlogarithmic factors involved in our algorithms, as well as related prior\nclassical and quantum algorithms, revealing the importance of “small”\nfactors and highlighting that advances are needed to render both practical.\nThe talk will conclude with some open questions.\n\n\n\n*Bio*: Eleanor G. Rieffel leads the Quantum Artificial Intelligence\nLaboratory at the NASA Ames Research Center, and is the NASA Senior\nResearcher for Advance Computing and Data Analytics. She was one of two\n2020 NASA Ames Associate Fellows. She joined NASA Ames Research Center in\n2012 to work on their expanding quantum computing effort. Previously, she\nperformed research in diverse fields at FXPAL, including quantum\ncomputation, applied cryptography, image-based geometric reconstruction of\n3D scenes, bioinformatics, video surveillance, and automated control code\ngeneration for modular robotics. Her current research focuses on quantum\nalgorithms, evaluation and utilization of near-term quantum hardware,\nfundamental resources for quantum computation, quantum error\ncharacterization and mitigation, distributed quantum computing, and\napplications of quantum computing. She received her Ph.D. in mathematics\nfrom the University of California, Los Angeles. She is best known for her\n2011 book Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction with coauthor Wolfgang\nPolak and published by MIT press.\n--\nTeam HCQCA\nWebsite & Interest Form: harvardquantum.com\nFollow us on Instagram: @harvardquantumcomputing\n<https://instagram.com/harvardquantumcomputing?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=>\n\n_______________________________________________\nhcs-discuss mailing list\nhcs-discuss@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/hcs-discuss\n"}],"-1165249418":[{"date":"2023-04-25T19:52:01.000Z","subject":"[Fyre] Quick Psych Survey","text":"Hi everyone!\n\nI'm doing a study for my psych class and it would mean so much if you could\nfill out this survey\n<https://streaklinks.com/Be2xrCaLiymopSvbzQw-jD7d/https%3A%2F%2Fharvard.az1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_3gGbkSV9dN8woIu>.\nThe survey is anonymous and would take around 3 minutes!\n\nThank you so much for your time <3\nChristy\n\n-- \nChristy Zheng\nB.A. Candidate in Government | Harvard University\nEmail: christy_zheng@college.harvard.edu\nᐧ\n\n_______________________________________________\nFYRE mailing list\nFYRE@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/fyre\n"}],"-701819877":[{"date":"2023-04-25T23:29:57.000Z","subject":"(Final!)

Azeem did well with almost all of the percent word problems that were assigned for homework. Afterwards, I gave Azeem a hard percent word problems worksheet that had 2 step problems. At first Azeem struggled to figure out how to solve the problems. After I walked him through a problem, Azeem was able to work through the other problems more individually. He showed clear understanding of the parts of each proportion and what value he was solving for in each proportion. I have included homework for non-percent proportion problems for homework. \n\n  Additional Comments:\n  Dear Janelle,\n\nI had a great session with Azeem last week. By the end of the session, he had a more individual approach to percent word problems, which I hope will translate over to the proportion word problems in the homework.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. \n\nRegards,\n\nEelaaf \n\n  Assignments for Next Week:\n  Please find the homework in the google drive. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e51Q_DRP-ag790OXKK_C-Mg_8y5TcL30?usp=sharing\n\n\n"}],"-993720558":[{"date":"2023-04-26T17:41:51.000Z","subject":"[hcs-d] Xfund Xperiment Stake Application Due 4/30","text":"Hi HCS,\n\nIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, Harvard Undergraduate Capital\nPartners, Harvard Student Agencies, Harvard Venture Capital Group, Harvard\nWomen in Computer Science, HBS Tech Club, Harvard Ventures, Harvard\nComputer Society, and Xfund present the Xperiment Stake: Xfund.com/xperiment\n<http://xfund.com/xperiment>.\n\nThe Xperiment is an opportunity to receive a minimum $100,000 investment in\nyour startup.

You may be eligible for extended stay or summer housing as a graduating senior, cross-registered student, independent applicant (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-6)  or as part of your work with a department or student organization (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-2) . Alternatively, you may choose to rent an apartment (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-5) from the College.\n\n\n** Housing Dates & Deadlines\n------------------------------------------------------------\nExtended Stay (May 14 Up Until June 1)\nYou must submit an application in the residential portal (http://harvard.starrezhousing.com/starrezportalx)  no later than 9:00 AM on Monday, May 1.\n\nSummer Housing (June 1 – August 14)\nYou must submit an application in the residential portal (http://harvard.starrezhousing.com/starrezportalx)  no later than 9:00 AM on Friday, May 5\n\n\n** Eligibility\n------------------------------------------------------------\nGraduating Seniors & Participants\nIf you are living on campus and attending Senior Week and Commencement as a graduate or participant, you may remain in your assigned housing until May 26 at 5:00 PM. If you are staying on campus, please reach out to your House Administrator (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/people/people-type/house-administrators) with questions. Participants are students attending this Commencement but graduating at another time.\n\nCross-Registered Students\nIf you are cross-registered in an MIT course and have a mandatory in-person academic commitment, you may remain on campus until one day after your required class or exam at no additional cost. Please register your stay via the residential portal (http://harvard.starrezhousing.com/starrezportalx)  and select Pre-Approved Groups.\n\nDepartments & Student Organizations\nYou may be eligible for summer housing through a student organization or department affiliation. They will notify you directly if you are eligible for housing and a meal plan and also if there is a cost to you.\n\nIndependent Requests\nYou may apply for extended stay and/or summer housing if you are facing housing insecurity and are unable to find alternate housing for some portion of Summer 2023. Availability is strictly limited to students who are unable to obtain housing due to health or safety concerns. We will begin sending decisions to students on Wednesday, May 3.\n\n\n** Cost and Financial Support\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIn response to student requests for better access to food and housing during the summer, the College is now providing meal plans with all extended stay and summer housing assignments for student organizations (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-2) and students who apply independently (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-6) .\n* The combined housing and dining rate will be $45/night, and financial support will be available to those who qualify. In addition to housing, you will receive dining hall access for 3 meals per day. All students remaining on campus for Extended Stay or Summer Housing must participate in the meal plan. This will ensure equitable access to dining for all students living on campus.\n* You will be billed the nightly rate for the entire time you are approved to be on campus, even if you are away from campus for a portion of the approved period.\n\nFinancial support:\nIf you request financial assistance, we will review your individual circumstances and partner with the Griffin Financial Aid Office to determine your eligibility. The level of financial support you will receive will be detailed in your housing offer email.\nExtended Stay and Summer Housing Details (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing)\n\n\n** Rentals\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIn addition to the options above, Harvard College is resuming its summer housing rental program (https://dso.college.harvard.edu/summer-housing?admin_panel=1#widget-5) . You can apply to rent an apartment, most commonly at 10 or 20 DeWolfe Street. Apartments include 2 bedroom / 4 bed units with kitchens and are rented as a whole unit.\n\nLicense Period\nThe license period for Summer Rentals begins on Friday, June 9 and ends on Monday, August 14.\n\nCost\nAn apartment rental for the entire license period costs $6,360.

Long school closures have put public education — and Randi\nWeingarten, the leader of a major teachers’ union — on the defensive.\n\n\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/30/magazine/28themorning-lede/28themorning-lede-jumbo.jpg]Randi\nWeingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.Pat Nabong/Chicago\nSun-Times, via Associated Press\n\n\nTHE LONG SHADOW OF SCHOOL CLOSURES\n\nDuring the early months of the Covid pandemic, Randi Weingarten and the\nteachers’ union she leads faced a vexing question: When should schools reopen?\n\nFor years, advocates of public education like Weingarten had argued that schools\nplayed an irreplaceable role. School was where children learned academic and\nsocial skills. It was where low-income children received subsidized meals.\nWithout public schools, their defenders argued, society would come apart.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, however, was the worst pandemic in a century.\nTeachers and parents feared that reopening schools before vaccines were\navailable would spark Covid outbreaks, illness and death.\n\nIn 2020, the pandemic’s first full year, Weingarten came down strongly on the\nside of keeping schools closed. Safety measures were not enough to reopen them,\nshe argued. Instead, Covid became an opportunity for her union, the American\nFederation of Teachers, to push for broader policy changes that it had long\nfavored. As my colleague Jonathan Mahler writes in a new story in the Times\nMagazine\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ZMy6UDZHF8RhGW6BLPS_jg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLiYlP0TmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yOC9tYWdhemluZS9yYW5kaS13ZWluZ2FydGVuLXRlYWNoZXJzLXVuaW9ucy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjgmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTEyNjEmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTU3MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD4loUtk31J_oFIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]:\n\nThe A.F.T. had issued its own reopening plan in late April calling for adequate\npersonal protective equipment, new cleaning and sanitization regimens in school\nbuildings, a temporary suspension of formal teacher performance evaluations, a\nlimit on student testing, a cancellation of student-loan debt and a $750 billion\nfederal aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate ‘‘a\nreal recovery for all our communities.’’\n\nIn retrospect, the strategy seems to have failed.\n\nToday’s newsletter, like Jonathan’s story, looks at the lingering costs to\npublic education.\n\n\nA LOST YEAR\n\nMany other education leaders took a different approach in 2020 and came to favor\na faster reopening of schools.

In conservative parts of the U.S.,\npublic schools also reopened, at times in consultation with local teachers’\nunions.\n\nSome people did contract Covid at these schools, but the overall effect on the\nvirus’s spread was close to zero. U.S. communities with closed schools had\nsimilar levels of Covid as communities with open schools, be they in the U.S. or\nEurope. How could that be? By the middle of 2020, there were many other ways for\nCovid to spread — in supermarkets, bars, restaurants and workplaces, as well as\nhomes where out-of-school children gathered with friends.\n\nDespite the emerging data that schools were not superspreaders, many U.S.\ndistricts remained closed well into 2021, even after vaccines were available.\nAbout half of American children lost at least a year of full-time school,\naccording to Michael Hartney of Boston College.\n\nAnd children suffered as a result.\n\nThey lost ground\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/_a5w1rr0v9G-p5r4VIhhCw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLiYlP0TpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNS9icmllZmluZy9zY2hvb2wtY2xvc3VyZXMtY292aWQtbGVhcm5pbmctbG9zcy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjgmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTEyNjEmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTU3MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD4loUtk31J_oFIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nin reading, math and other subjects.

Nationwide\nenrollment fell by 1.3 million, or 3 percent, according to the latest federal\ndata. The share of U.S. adults with little or no trust in public schools rose by\na few percentage points, to 33 percent, according to Gallup. In last year’s\nelections, political candidates who supported vouchers — which effectively\nreduce public-school funding — fared well, as Jonathan explains in his story.\n\n“It’s pretty undeniable that the last few years have been bad for public schools\n— even very bad,” he told me.\n\n\nA DEMOCRATIC FAILURE\n\nI recommend his story\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/ZMy6UDZHF8RhGW6BLPS_jg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLiYlP0TmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yOC9tYWdhemluZS9yYW5kaS13ZWluZ2FydGVuLXRlYWNoZXJzLXVuaW9ucy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjgmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTEyNjEmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTU3MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD4loUtk31J_oFIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\nbecause it’s a nuanced look at Weingarten and the challenges she now faces.\nRepublican officials have spent years trying to demonize teachers’ unions, and\nWeingarten in particular (including during a House hearing this week\n[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/l55t5TFjgSIFcbBRt6hARA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmLiYlP4QRAWh0dHBzOi8vZWRzb3VyY2Uub3JnL3VwZGF0ZXMvdGVhY2hlcnMtdW5pb24tcHJlc2lkZW50LXJhbmRpLXdlaW5nYXJ0ZW4tdGVzdGlmaWVzLWJlZm9yZS1jb25ncmVzcy1vbi1jb3ZpZC0xOS1zY2hvb2wtY2xvc3VyZXM_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyOCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MTI2MSZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxNTczJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkPiWhS2TfUn-gUh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA]),\nand have been less successful than they hoped. In Michigan, where Weingarten\ncampaigned for Democrats last year, as she frequently does, the party won a\nsweep of major offices. In Chicago (an overwhelmingly Democratic city), a former\nteachers’ union organizer, Brandon Johnson, was elected mayor this month.\n\nThese results reflect the fact that many Americans are sympathetic to teachers\nand grateful to their children’s own teachers. Teachers do vital work and don’t\nmake big salaries. Many spend their own money on teaching materials when schools\ndon’t do so.\n\nIn the case of Covid, the risks associated with reopening schools were unclear\nin the spring of 2020, and teachers were understandably frightened. Over the\ncourse of the summer, however, evidence increasingly suggested that schools\ncould reopen without accelerating the spread of Covid — and that the costs of\nkeeping them closed were steep. Despite this evidence, many schools remained\nclosed for months on end, even after vaccines became available.\n\nDasgupta, the Berkeley philosopher, has a thoughtful way of framing this\nfailure. As he wrote to me in an email:\n\nIt is clear that extended school closures were a mistake — they harmed children\nwhile having no measurable effect on the pandemic. It is also clear that\nteachers’ unions were a major factor behind the closures. But remember that the\nunions were just doing their job. Their remit is to advocate for their members\nand that is exactly what they did.\n\nSeen like this, the problem was not the teachers’ union per se — I am personally\nin favor of public sector unions — but the absence of a comparable organization\nat the bargaining table to represent the interests of students and their\ncaregivers. It was a failure of democratic decision-making.\n\nLooking ahead, my colleague Jonathan puts it this way:\n\nThe question (and political debate) is where do we go from here — double down on\npublic education, try to address the learning loss and emotional damage caused\nby the pandemic closures and make an effort to restore the nation’s confidence\nin public schools, or create more alternatives via school choice?\n\nAs Jonathan notes, public education is likely to be a major issue again in the\n2024 campaigns.

My friend and fellow poet Robin Coste Lewis (https://poets.org/poet/robin-coste-lewis?mc_cid=168771921b&mc_eid=UNIQID) and I divided up ‘The Inferno’ and wrote our respective versions after I was asked by the Museum of Modern Art to respond to Robert Rauschenberg’s drawings based on ‘The Inferno,’ which a friend had read to the artist canto (https://poets.org/glossary/canto?mc_cid=168771921b&mc_eid=UNIQID) by canto, circle by circle. I happened to have grown up with the same John Ciardi (https://poets.org/poet/john-ciardi?mc_cid=168771921b&mc_eid=UNIQID) translation that Rauschenberg heard and, in composing my cantos, incorporated the Dante I first encountered as a teenager, together with African American cosmologies and spirituals that grounded me. Without telling a soul, after the initial project I continued to write through the rest of The Divine Comedy. As its title suggests, ‘Ledge’ is from the ‘Purgatory’ section, which, in our current era of social and\nbodily strife—not unlike Dante’s own time—manages to offer some hard-won hope.”\n—Kevin Young\nhttps://poets.org/poet/kevin-young?mc_cid=168771921b&mc_eid=UNIQID\n\nKevin Young (https://poets.org/poet/kevin-young?mc_cid=168771921b&mc_eid=UNIQID) is the author of Stones (Knopf, 2021) and the children’s book Emile and the Field (Knopf, 2022), among other titles.

Our system passively listens to a conversation between a\nuser and an interviewer where the user is invited to complete a series of\ncritical thinking assessments. The user is able to utilize AI assistance in\ncompleting these tasks by prompting an AI assistant with eye gaze, which\nthen displays the assistance in real time augmented reality. The goal of\nthis system is passive, real-time integration of human and artificial\nintelligence.\n\nDuring the study (~70min), you will complete a series of questions,\nutilizing one of the world’s most advanced commercial AR headsets (HoloLens\n2), that costs $3500. Study Dates: 4/28-4/30.\n\nYou will then participate in a post-study survey. Study participants will\nreceive a $20 worth gift card after the research.

They might very well remember the\nprecise page number of the paperback that was passed around middle school on\nwhich the most eye-opening passages appeared.\n\nI recently reread her classic, “Are You There God?

I vividly remembered the famous scenes when\nMargaret first encounters sanitary napkins and when she and her friends do\nexercises in order to “get out of those baby bras,” chanting, “We must — we must\n— we must increase our bust!”\n\nAs I reread the book, though, I was struck not only by its Big Moments, but also\nby the many small, almost trivial ones that I’d unwittingly assimilated into my\nunderstanding of the world.\n\nThere’s an early scene in which Margaret’s father injures himself while mowing\nthe lawn and Margaret runs out into the yard “to look for the limb,” in case the\ndoctor might be able to sew it back on.\n\nI stopped short. This scene was as real to me as one of my own memories. When\nI’d read the book as an adolescent, it was the first time I’d heard about such a\ngrisly surgical procedure. I didn’t actively think of it again, but “you should\nalways look for the limb” became part of my smart aleck’s understanding of the\nworld, a bit of wisdom, never questioned. I never tied this knowledge back to\nthe book or any source.\n\n“Margaret” also instilled in me the belief that wearing loafers with socks makes\none “look like a baby” and that it was possible to get a custom label made for a\nhomemade sweater that said “Made Expressly for You … by Grandma.” Small details,\ncertainly not the main themes of the book, not what I’d tell any adult at the\ntime that I “took away” from reading it.\n\n“Margaret” the movie — which you should see if you loved the book, or loved the\ndirector Kelly Fremon Craig’s first film, “Edge of Seventeen” — is full of these\ndetails, moments that change a young reader quietly. Watching it, I felt little\nelectrical connections being made between my childhood brain and my adult brain,\nbetween the data that was inputted decades ago and the coherent knowledge it’s\nbecome.\n\n\nFOR MORE\n\n * Blume, Fremon Craig and the film’s stars discussed the novel’s cultural\n   impact\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/2YLBbATgkclz-x_X0IDXlg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0TqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yMC9tb3ZpZXMvYXJlLXlvdS10aGVyZS1nb2QtaXRzLW1lLW1hcmdhcmV0LWZpbG0uaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMzY3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE2NzUmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-VPFMZP8mXf1SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~].\n * “Somebody used to say to me, ‘Just wait till all these kids who grew up with\n   you get to those positions of power in Hollywood — you will see.’” Blume on\n   how the “Margaret” film finally came to be\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/-V7ugI7aHeI-WpmtKBQTFA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS9qdWR5LWJsdW1lLWhvbGx5d29vZC5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjkmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTEzNjcmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTY3NSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD5U8Uxk_yZd_VIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~].\n * “To us, Margaret Simon wasn’t a character, she was a proxy — for the girl who\n   stuffed socks in her bra, who felt uncomfortable in her own skin; for the\n   girl who was homesick for a friend who had matured overnight or moved away or\n   turned mean; for the girl who struggled to make sense of the diagrams on the\n   origami-folded instructions inside the tampon box.” The Times’s Elisabeth\n   Egan on the book’s enduring appeal.\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/vF3N-jsMj9Q5jzyb6qatvw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0TxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yNy9ib29rcy9qdWR5LWJsdW1lLWFyZS15b3UtdGhlcmUtaXRzLW1lLW1hcmdhcmV0LW1vdmllLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDQyOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05MTM2NyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTk4MTA5MTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTMxNjc1JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1iYTJmZjY5ZWQ2ZTlmZWM2ZjMxZjMyMmNlNTM0YmQxNVcDbnl0QgpkPlTxTGT_Jl39Uh9lZWxhYWZ6YWhpZEBjb2xsZWdlLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1WAQAAAAA]\n * From April 2020, Cheryl Strayed’s podcast interview\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/yQDutQ3bcZr9Av-A3eia4A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0TvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wNC8yOS9wb2RjYXN0cy9zdWdhci1jYWxsaW5nLWp1ZHktYmx1bWUtcXVhcmFudGluZS12aXJ1cy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA0MjkmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTEzNjcmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD05ODEwOTE2OCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzMTY3NSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTVXA255dEIKZD5U8Uxk_yZd_VIfZWVsYWFmemFoaWRAY29sbGVnZS5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~]\n   with Blume.\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAd\n[https://liveintent.newyorktimesinfo.com/imp?s=859187&li=NN&m=ba2ff69ed6e9fec6f31f322ce534bd15&p=NN_20230429]https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/YBySevIniU_jZ0KqbmqTfg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0SWaHR0cHM6Ly9saXZlaW50ZW50Lm5ld3lvcmt0aW1lc2luZm8uY29tL2NsaWNrP3M9ODU5MTg3JmxpPU5OJm09YmEyZmY2OWVkNmU5ZmVjNmYzMWYzMjJjZTUzNGJkMTUmcD1OTl8yMDIzMDQyOSZ0ZT0xJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI5VwNueXRCCmQ-VPFMZP8mXf1SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~\n\n\nTHE WEEK IN CULTURE\n\n[https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/28/multimedia/29-THE-MORNING-NL-harry/29-THE-MORNING-NL-harry-jumbo.jpg]Harry\nBelafonte.(Photo by Keystone/Getty Images)\n\n * Cool and charismatic, Harry Belafonte, who died this week at 96, channeled\n   his stardom\n   [https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/tluz9HszigDnmjiaoWdjRw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmL3ZUP0TnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yNS9hcnRzL211c2ljL2hhcnJ5LWJlbGFmb250ZS1zaW5nZXItYWN0aXZpc3QuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNDI5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTkxMzY3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9OTgxMDkxNjgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzE2NzUmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWJhMmZmNjllZDZlOWZlYzZmMzFmMzIyY2U1MzRiZDE1VwNueXRCCmQ-VPFMZP8mXf1SH2VlbGFhZnphaGlkQGNvbGxlZ2UuaGFydmFyZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~]\n   into activism.

The summer program is\ndivided into two parts - the incubator, where students build an idea from\nthe ground up, and consulting, where students tackle specific business\nchallenges for startups. Our unique hybrid consulting/incubator approach\nallows students to develop crucial skills that can be applied towards\nstarting their own companies or future careers. We work primarily with\nearly-stage startups and cover a wide range of industries, from healthcare,\nrobotics, and education to web3 and AI.\n\nThe incubator program culminates in a demo day, where student teams pitch\ntheir ideas to a panel of investors, experts, and advisors. The winning\nteam receives a free client voucher, redeemable for free services from our\noperators the following year.\n\nFor your reference, I’ve also attached a flier you could share along with a\nblurb to post around:\n\n“Join the ultimate summer experience with Startery's Summer Intensive\nProgram. Develop in-demand skills by working on client projects and bring\nyour own startup ideas to life, all at the same time! Get hands-on guidance\nfrom experienced entrepreneurs and a chance to compete for a free client\nvoucher. This is the perfect opportunity to equip yourself with skills that\nwill set you apart in the workforce and launch your own entrepreneurial\njourney!”\n\nThanks you so much for your help!\n\nBest,\n\nTejas\n\nTejas Ravindra\n*Founding Partner at Startery LLP*\n*tejas@startery.io <tejas@startery.io>*\n\nCONFIDENTIAL NOTICE: The information transmitted is intended only for the\nperson or entity to which it is addressed and may contain proprietary,\nbusiness-confidential and/or privileged material.

Vote using this link\n<https://forms.gle/PWNKgMuESHPhHMWG6> by 5pm on Tuesday, May 2. Candidate\nstatements are below:\n\n---------------\n\n*Jacob Fernandes (running for co-president):* When I first joined HULS, I\nwas a first year who knew that I loved linguistics and creating conlangs,\nbut knew literally nobody outside of a tiny reddit community who shared\nthis interest. As far as I knew, I just had some weird niche interest. But\nat HULS, I found a community who welcomed me, nerded out with me and let me\nindulge in my conlangery by teaching, learning, and collaborating. As a\nHULS board member and longtime HULS member, I have gained a greater\nappreciation for everyone in the club and what it means to run a student\norganization. I have made an impact on the club already, like helping\norganize and host HULS' first Halloween Party. But I want to be able to\nlead HULS to a brighter future, where we can reach even more students,\nwhether they are casual linguistics, computer scientists, professional\nresearchers, or even semanticists.\n\n*Blake Lopez (running for co-president):* While serving as your\nCo-President this past year, I’ve been lucky enough to get to know you all\nand to learn how best to run our club, and I want to continue serving as\nyour Co-President this upcoming academic year in order to take advantage of\nthis knowledge and give you all the best experience possible. Together,\nwe’ve landed high-level guest speakers like Barbara Partee and Gennaro\nChierchia—for next year, why not try to get Noam Chomsky to make a long\nawaited in-person appearance? Or to get anyone else you’d like to see? The\nsky’s the limit! The sky’s also the limit for the hilarious new\ndevelopments we’ve made in our conlang, which I hope to continue helping us\nto innovate. It’s been my honor to serve as your Co-President, and I hope\nto get the chance to make our next year, my last year here, a great one.\n\n*Antara Bhattacharya (running for secretary): *Hi I'm Antara and I am\nperpetually Very Excited about linguistics things! I've been in HULS since\nI arrived on campus and I love the wonderful linguistics community and all\nour weekly meeting chaos/increasingly cursed conlanging. I would like to\nhelp make more of it happen! As secretary I want to do lots of fun stuff\nlike run meetings for constructing/solving linguistics olympiad problems (I\nam very involved with running ling olympiads!), finally having the\nlinguistics meme meeting, and getting more students involved + getting more\nguest speakers. You all are awesome I love HULS <3\n\n*John Harrington (running for treasurer):* HULS is one of the highlights of\nmy week where I get to hang out and do wacky linguistics stuff with\nlike-minded peers. I've previously served as Logistics Manager, and have\nhelped out in an unofficial capacity this past semester after my time\nabroad, and I would love to continue to help facilitate the activities and\noperations of the club next year as Treasurer.\n\n---------\n\nIt's been amazing working with all four of these people, who've all helped\nout with Linguistics Society officially and unofficially this semester.\nThanks to everyone who came to meetings this last year!
