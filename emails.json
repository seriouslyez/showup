This position is especially great\nfor any graduating seniors looking for some more lab experience before\ngoing on to graduate school/medical school. The Buratowski lab, which is in\nthe BCMP department at Harvard Medical School, is looking for a lab\ntechnician/research assistant, with a possibility to start as early as this\nmonth. The application details as well as more information about the\nposition are in the document I have attached to this email.\n\nI have been conducting research in the Buratowski lab since last summer and\ncannot say enough about how great of a lab it is. We are pretty small,\nwhich makes it a really close-knit environment where everyone is very\ncollaborative. Steve, the PI, is extremely accessible, and you would get to\nbe very involved in the research. Additionally, depending on how long you\nplan to stay, Steve is very open to techs overseeing projects of their own.\nHappy to answer any questions, as is Steve, about the lab environment or\nthe position itself!\n\nBest,\nBrynn\n\n_______________________________________________\nCheck the Adams FAQ for answers to many common questions: http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions\n***List emails may not be reproduced, retransmitted, or otherwise republished without the express written consent of the author.\n\nadams-schmooze mailing list\nadams-schmooze@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/adams-schmooze\n"}],"867371626":[{"date":"2023-05-01T17:39:22.000Z","subject":"Assignment Graded: Programming Assignment 2, COMPSCI 143: Computer Networks","text":"\nYour assignment Programming Assignment 2 has been graded.\n\ngraded: May 1 at 12:39pm\n\n\nYou can review the assignment here:\nhttps://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/116988/assignments/685585/submissions/264082\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nYou received this email because you are participating in one or more classes using Canvas.

There are still internships to be had at this date, but you need to make sure that the internship salary or stipend will cover your costs (i.e., don't expect Harvard or outside subsidies). I continue to list some on Crimson Careers. A few suggestions:\n\nHave a great cover letter.\nSign up for the company's newsletter.  Read their published reports/newsletter to gain more insight into the company and find a contact at the company that way.  This information could provide a great starting sentence for your cover letter.\n\nUse key words or phrasing that the company uses.\nIf a company such Altman Solon (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=88187a707a&e=65d2b2b7c0) (which has three internships listed: Strategy Intern in Milan/Italy, (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=a242d79308&e=65d2b2b7c0) Research intern, (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=e0d5260bab&e=65d2b2b7c0) and Strategy Intern Munich) (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=745905f01b&e=65d2b2b7c0) is talking about \"Consultants\" ,\"Services\" and \"Expertise,\" then you should use these terms in your cover letter and maybe even in your resume.\n\nExpand your internship search beyond a certain geographical area.\nMany European companies have international subsidiaries. If your goal was to be in Europe this summer, you might still find an internship with the same company, but in a different location. A good example would be Zeiss (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=93da6237b9&e=65d2b2b7c0) , which offers internships worldwide.\n\nUse different search terms and consider industries that you have not considered before.\nHere are a few companies that offer internships:\nRocket Factory Augsburg (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=8eaadd9afd&e=65d2b2b7c0)  - international space start-up company.\nSAP (https://harvard.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=598d73b470a40f403bba4fb2c&id=45cbbc761e&e=65d2b2b7c0)\n\nCompanies are not always offering internships online, and deadlines are sometimes missing in the descriptions of those that are.
