This position is especially great\nfor any graduating seniors looking for some more lab experience before\ngoing on to graduate school/medical school. The Buratowski lab, which is in\nthe BCMP department at Harvard Medical School, is looking for a lab\ntechnician/research assistant, with a possibility to start as early as this\nmonth. The application details as well as more information about the\nposition are in the document I have attached to this email.\n\nI have been conducting research in the Buratowski lab since last summer and\ncannot say enough about how great of a lab it is. We are pretty small,\nwhich makes it a really close-knit environment where everyone is very\ncollaborative. Steve, the PI, is extremely accessible, and you would get to\nbe very involved in the research. Additionally, depending on how long you\nplan to stay, Steve is very open to techs overseeing projects of their own.\nHappy to answer any questions, as is Steve, about the lab environment or\nthe position itself!\n\nBest,\nBrynn\n\n_______________________________________________\nCheck the Adams FAQ for answers to many common questions: http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions\n***List emails may not be reproduced, retransmitted, or otherwise republished without the express written consent of the author.\n\nadams-schmooze mailing list\nadams-schmooze@lists.hcs.harvard.edu\nhttps://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/adams-schmooze\n"}],"867371626":[{"date":"2023-05-01T17:39:22.000Z","subject":"Assignment Graded: Programming Assignment 2, COMPSCI 143: Computer Networks","text":"\nYour assignment Programming Assignment 2 has been graded.\n\ngraded: May 1 at 12:39pm\n\n\nYou can review the assignment here:\nhttps://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/116988/assignments/685585/submissions/264082\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nYou received this email because you are participating in one or more classes using Canvas.
